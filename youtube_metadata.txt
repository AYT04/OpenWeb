Modded Xbox Accounts are a Gamble. Buying modded accounts on Xbox is a common practice in the Xbox LFG. But it comes at a risk. The biggest risk of buying modded Xbox Accounts is the SCAM. It‚Äôs common to get scammed when it comes to buying something over the Xbox LFG. When it comes to catching scammers on Xbox, I‚Äôm required to pay the scammer to PROVE they are a scammer. But there are cases when it‚Äôs not a scam or at least a missed opportunity because the possible scammer knows who I am. But without evidence, it‚Äôs not simple when it comes to scamming on Xbox.

I was shopping for scammers on Xbox and found a post from someone that was claiming they were selling a modded Xbox account. The usual practice is if they‚Äôre a scammer, they get exposed. If they‚Äôre not, I would give the modded account away to a random person. The seller knew who I was and sold me a modded account on Xbox. I initially paid him $20 but felt bad since he didn‚Äôt make a profit from it, so I payed him again with $40, making the modded account $60. The seller also made a $15 profit since he originally paid $45 for the modded Xbox account.

Eventually, I have the modded account away to my RGH guy (Robert) since I felt he deserved due to the service he provides me. I hand skid‚Äôs gamertags over to him and he bans them from the game. So the moral of this story is, buying anything from Xbox LFG is a huge gamble and comes with a risk. In this case, the gamble was a win and no one was scammed. If no one gets scammed on Xbox, then I can sleep on it peacefully.

Description: the conservatives fumbling their lead in the Canadian polls might be one of the biggest in modern political history

Now that Mark Carney is the prime minister I wanted to make a video finally stooping down to the conservative level and making fun and attacking their guy.

mini ai essay for algo
Pierre Poilievre‚Äôs Conservative Party has been facing a significant decline in the polls in comparison to Mark Carney‚Äôs Liberals. This shift can be attributed to several key factors that have weakened Poilievre‚Äôs appeal and strengthened Carney‚Äôs position.

First, Poilievre‚Äôs combative style of politics, which often relies on populist rhetoric, has alienated some moderate voters. While his bold approach appeals to his core base, it has failed to resonate with centrist Canadians who are seeking stability and a more unifying political vision. Poilievre's harsh criticism of the Liberal government has often veered into divisive territory, making it difficult for many voters to see him as a viable leader for all Canadians.

Additionally, Carney's reputation as a former Bank of Canada governor and an internationally recognized economist has lent credibility to the Liberal Party. In times of economic uncertainty, voters tend to gravitate towards leaders with a background in managing the economy, especially when inflation, housing affordability, and economic recovery are top concerns. Carney‚Äôs expertise and calm demeanor offer a stark contrast to Poilievre‚Äôs more incendiary approach.

Furthermore, the Liberal Party has successfully positioned itself as a more moderate, pragmatic choice during difficult times. Mark Carney, with his emphasis on climate action and responsible economic policies, has garnered support from those concerned about the future of the planet and the long-term health of Canada‚Äôs economy. His appeal to younger, more environmentally-conscious voters has strengthened the Liberal Party‚Äôs standing in polls.

Lastly, Poilievre's party has faced internal divisions and controversies that have weakened their messaging. As the Conservatives struggle with cohesion, it becomes easier for the Liberals to maintain their lead, positioning themselves as the party of unity and progressive solutions.

In summary, Pierre Poilievre‚Äôs Conservatives are facing a decline in the polls primarily due to his divisive political tactics, Carney‚Äôs strong economic credentials, and the Liberals' successful branding as a moderate, forward-thinking party. With the economic climate in flux, voters are turning to leaders they perceive as more reliable and capable of leading Canada through challenging times.

She‚Äôs the Most Racist Girl on Xbox. Xbox game chat always had a racial problem that Microsoft never saw coming. When MW2 (2009) was released, this game chat lobbies were so toxic, Activision had to double down on report options. Game chat isn‚Äôt as prevalent as it was back in the Xbox 360 days, but whenever there is game chat, it will always have ‚Äúthat one guy.‚Äù In this case, ‚Äúthat one girl.‚Äù This was on Modern Sweatfare 2. A game that unfortunately has cross-play but is notorious with some game chat lobbies that are filled with more than just simply trash talking.

I was enjoying some Prisoner Rescue on Modern Sweatfare 2 and that‚Äôs where I met the most racist girl on Xbox. At first, everything was normal. She was actively talking in game chat where she started giving me friendly advice on what to do in order to win. Needless to say, I didn‚Äôt listen but eventually turned my mic on. A gentleman on the enemy team started doing the usual trash talking which is what it all was, simply trash talking. Trash talking is normal, especially when someone on the opposing team criticizes your skill level, or just about anything related to the game. So to me, it was a normal environment in the game. She eventually called the said gentleman a monkey because of his skin color. From there, sure it was trash talking but with racial slurs.

I told her it‚Äôs not ok to just say that but she disagreed and felt it was normal. After the game ended, I figured I‚Äôd throw her under the bus just for laughs. So I told the gentleman on the enemy team that she called him a monkey. Due to the sweat based matchmaking system, the lobby disbanded but she sent me an invite. Again for laughs, I joined. I figured she wanted to give me a piece of her mind for calling her out like that. So after I joined her lobby, she was asking me why I called her out and that she would‚Äôve called him a monkey regardless if I called her out or not. So throwing her under the bus was useless in that regard, but she probably would‚Äôve never sent me an invite if I didn‚Äôt.

She eventually referred to me as a derogatory word against gays, so again, I told her that‚Äôs not ok. But to my foolishness, I spawned the racial demon in her. She went on, ranting and manifestoing about how particular people are monkeys, or border-hoppers, or crackers, etc. Her racism was basically based on stereotypes for some groups. I‚Äôve met a lot of racist people on Xbox. But she was definitely the first to go that far with the stereotypes. I very much understand trash talking. All of us do it and it‚Äôs just a normal part of online gaming. It becomes less trash talk and more discrimination once skin color, ethnicity, etc gets involved heavily. And in her case, all that racism was involved heavily.

During the encounter, a simp got involved. Realizing she‚Äôs a girl, he kept haggling her for her socials like Instagram. This pretty much ruined parts of the video since she shutdown and became quiet. I assumed she became uncomfortable with the simp trying to be a ‚Äúplayer.‚Äù After the game, she kicked me out. I sent her a message as I do with many other people, giving her a chance to explain herself or just state anything that might have been a misconception. She ignored the message. So I sent her a party invite which she rejected so I figured that would wrap the video from there. I‚Äôm using a new Xbox console, so I don‚Äôt want to do anything that Microsoft may label as ‚Äúharassment.‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to avoid any more bans so I‚Äôm changing up how I confront certain types of players.

It took a total of 13 seconds for the Samsung Galaxy phone to hit the ground, and it kept recording. It happened when pilot Blake Henderson was flying a small aircraft over Bowling Green, Ky., recently. "I was flying the plane and filming, kind of shooting from the hip, and got too close to the window and it was drawn out and it was sucked out of the aircraft," he told Inside Edition. #InsideEdition

We took it home, dried it, tried it out and is working just fine. The case is a little corroded but in very good condition! The memory card still works, if anyone knows this kid let me know!         http://tinyurl.com/pld8vrl
{{{{{UPDATE}}}}}}:  The owner of the Gopro contacted me. I verified it was theirs. It turned out the Gopro was lost for 2 years NOT 5 and that the GoPro doesnt work. We returned it about a month after posting this video.

Description: http://g-form.com -- G-Form, a company well known for delivering the most extreme electronics cases and athletic pads, launched an iPad clad solely in the company's 6oz Perimeter case into space and then let it free-fall back to Earth.

The company released a stunning hi-def video Thursday where the nearly naked iPad is shown hanging above the Earth in the blackness of space. In the video, the iPad is lifted to over 100,000 feet by a weather balloon which bursts at altitude, then releasing the iPad to free-fall to Earth where it crash lands on a rocky hillside in the Nevada countryside. Perhaps even more remarkable than the dramatic hi-def footage itself is the fact that the iPad survives the adventure, remaining fully functional.

Description: DrDisrespect came under a lot of scrutiny recently after a former Twitch employee made a post accusing doc of talking to a minor via twitch whispers back in 2017, after some form of investigation by Midnight Society the company Doc had invested a lot of time to promote and was a co founder of decided to cut all ties with Guy Beahm aka DrDisrespect, as did Turtle Beach a long time sponsor of the Doc, this video shows the moment he found out all of this information live on stream and he appears visibly upset to say the least, playing Elden Ring at the time may have given this moment a unique extra layer of depth as the eerie background music kicks in at the exact point of him reading the message from Midnight Society, giving the footage a movie like soundtrack of otherworldly proportion‚Äôs, Doc did later admit via Twitter that messages between him and a minor were exchanged back in 2017 and that they sometimes ‚Äúleaned into inappropriate‚Äù leaving everybody speculating as to what was said in those messages, whilst simultaneously losing all of his online friends including ‚Äã‚Å†@timthetatman ‚Äã‚Å†@NICKMERCS ‚Äã‚Å†@shroud ‚Äã‚Å†@Ninja who have publicly denounced the Doc and cut all ties with him,  Doc has now taken an extended vacation and may never return to streaming after this

Description: CANZUK is a proposed diplomatic union between Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom that, while swirling around the political ecosystems of these countries for many years, has begun to gather a lot of momentum in recent weeks, particularly as a direct consequence of the brazen actions of the current US administration under President Donald Trump, who, in his drive to pull the United States out of any positions of global leadership and supposedly drive up the domestic American economy, i.e. isolationism, has adopted brash rhetoric towards even the US‚Äô closest allies, namely Canada and the EU. But now even Australia and the United Kingdom have been subjected to sweeping tariffs, despite both countries having trade surpluses with America, meaning in the simplest terms, that they buy more goods from the US, than the US buys from them. So this all begs the question, with such an unpredictable and now seemingly unreliable occupant of the White House, and the very fate of the established Western rules-based global order that has existed for the last 80 years since the end of World War 2 under such serious threat, is it time for these four nations, bound so closely in culture, language and history, to form a new, bolstered union to protect and preserve their ideals?

Description: The importance of maritime trade for the global economy can‚Äôt be understated. After all, roughly 80% of all goods transported worldwide are transported by sea. That‚Äôs why global nations continuously invest in maritime infrastructure, striving to enhance their geopolitical influence by strategically controlling critical maritime routes. 

But there‚Äôs a single country poised to become a key player in the future of maritime trade ‚Äì Canada.
Canada‚Äôs promising future rests on a few essential factors ‚Äì its extensive coastline, ice-free ports, and strategic location. However, none of these factors is as crucial as Canada‚Äôs potential in the Arctic, the real reason this country is considered the future of maritime trade. 

Canada‚Äôs control over the Arctic could unearth unprecedented opportunities for economic growth, resource extraction, and geopolitical influence on the global stage. If all goes according to plan, Canada could irreversibly reshape the global maritime trade dynamics. Of course, that‚Äôs a big ‚Äúif.‚Äù

To be honest I would never had guessed that there would be so many differences between high school in Canada and high school in the United States, but I have never been to happy to be wrong. I am extremely interested to react and learn about the unique differences between Canada and the US, from my American perspective.

Description: Stampy's main Minecraft helper from all of his Lovely World let's play videos was caught doing awful things and got exposed online for these with the situation even being covered on the news. StampyLongHead then had the challenge of getting rid of his fan favourite character without upsetting his young fan base while also not being able to tell the truth of why Lee bear was leaving his series. There are many ways he could have handled this controversy which would have negatice effects on his viewers but he actually incorporated L For Lee leaving his Lovely World into the storyline of his videos. This was a really move from Stampy being able to spin Lee leaving into a positive thing leaving his subscribers with a nice final goodbye memory to the beloved character and the comments section is full of people saying goodbye to L for Lee without being scarred by the creepy things he did. This shows how professional Stampy is as a youtuber and that he really cares about protecting his audience rather than doing nothing and avoiding anything to do with L For Lee which would confuse his fans and they could end up finding out what happened in a worse way. Thank you to Stampy for being a big part of so many peoples childhoods and I hope more people continue to grow up watching your videos as they truly are special :)

Description: Sqaishey made a statement on my video from last year to talk about their side of the situation with L for Lee being removed from Stampy's Lovely World. I feel like some people would like to hear this because there hasn't been mention of what really happened in 2015 and there is lots of confusion as to why Lee Bear stopped being in Stampy's videos.

Will he scam a broke father? We‚Äôre gonna put an Xbox Account Seller up to a test. If the Xbox Account Seller is indeed a scammer, will he scam a poor and single dad who is simply trying to get his daughter a modded Xbox account? Will he get in touch with reality and back out of the scam? Or will he sell the modded Xbox account to the broke father and even help him with the price? Lots of things happened in this video that say he was a scammer but was also legit. Let‚Äôs just say I paid more than what the potential scammer on Xbox was selling.

On Fortnite Looking for Groups, I came across a post from someone who was claiming to be selling a rare Fortnite account. He didn‚Äôt say the price in the post but in the Xbox party chat, he explained that it was for $20. I posed as a broke and single father who wanted to buy the account for his imaginary daughter. After acting out the sob story of being in a struggling financial situation, the Xbox Account seller offered to sell me the rare Fortnite account for only $10 instead of $20. He then offered to give me a free modded GTA Xbox account. Eventually, we learn that I end up paying more than just the $10 and the modded GTA account was virtually useless.

The Xbox Account Seller eventually raises the price of the Fortnite account because of its rarity. It allegedly has a lot of rare skins, camos, weapons, etc. I end up accessing that Fortnite account but I‚Äôm not too familiar with Fortnite, so I‚Äôm not sure if the rare inventory was true or I was looking at random BS on the Fortnite account. The Xbox Account Seller eventually demands more money than the $10 we agreed upon. He wanted food so he demanded an Uber Eats gift card. His payment options were sketchy though. I was posing as a broke father that only had $15 to his name. But the Xbox Account Seller offered to log into my bank account to transfer money into his bank, etc. He was trying many ways in attempts of getting more money.

Eventually, he gives me the email and all that for the Fortnite account. I check it out and everything seemed legitimate. HOWEVER, we end up learning that the Xbox Account Seller was attempting to sell the Fortnite account to other people. The account was already purchased by me so it shouldn‚Äôt be for sale anymore. He also kept all his security details in the account to prevent me from changing the email or anything on the account. I am currently awaiting to get full access to the Fortnite account. Once that is granted, I‚Äôll give the account away to a subscriber or something. The modded GTA account was useless as it was permanently banned from GTA Online.

Do you like YouTube ads? I'm gonna guess the answer is no, and I feel the same way as you. They're annoying. Very annoying.

Unless you have YouTube premium, unfortunately, the ads just keep getting worse and worse. Thanks YouTube.

Today, you and I are gonna take a look at the evolution of YouTube ads, and how over time, they've gotten absolutely ridiculous.

I love how this guy jumps straight to, "Do you have any money with you?" The quiet talkers' number is no longer active, but you can find numbers at places like 800notes.com, Twitters, and FB groups devoted to wasting the time of scammers.

Description: Hey, it's Benaminute. In this experiment, I take on the ultimate challenge: posting strictly leftist (aka woke) content on X (formerly Twitter) to see how long it takes before the ban hammer falls. With Elon Musk's vision of "free speech" seemingly favoring a certain ideological direction, I push the boundaries by posting progressively more left-leaning content, testing the limits of X's moderation policies.

Is "free speech" truly for everyone, or does X have a different standard for those on the left?

I am very excited to once again take a look at some of the most popular Canadian TikToks on the internet. I enjoy watching these because Canadian TikToks tend to contain a mixture of funny, educational, and insightful knowledge into Canadian culture that you just can't find anywhere else.

Description: Sock Puppet News breaks down the story: Apps The fediverse is getting its own TikTok competitor called Loops Sarah Perez 10:44 AM PDT ¬∑ October 25, 2024 Similar to how Mastodon offers an open source, distributed version of X, the fediverse is getting its own TikTok competitor. This week, an app called Loops began accepting signups on its new platform for sharing short, looping videos. Still in the early stages, Loops is not yet open sourced, nor has it completed its integration with ActivityPub, the protocol that powers Mastodon, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and other federated apps. However, both those efforts are in the works and when complete, will allow Loops to add another layer of social activity to the growing open social web known as the fediverse, which now has north of 11.6 million users and over 1 million monthly active users. (Mastodon accounts for roughly 65% of that activity.) Growth in this space has also encouraged other apps to adopt ActivityPub, like social magazine app Flipboard and Meta‚Äôs Threads. The latter is not yet fully integrated but already has more than 200 million monthly active users. Loops, meanwhile, was developed by Daniel Supernault, who also created the federated Instagram rival Pixelfed. In fact, Loops will run under the Pixelfed project, according to an FAQ on its website. In addition to the eventual benefit of being open source and distributed, Loops claims it will not sell or provide user data to third-party advertisers, use your content to train AI models, or gain the rights to any content uploaded on its service. Instead, users only grant Loops permission to use their content, but will retain full ownership of their contributions, the Loops website explains. Like many fediverse projects, Loops isn‚Äôt reliant on investor backing. To raise funds, Loops will seek user donations via Patreon, Open Collective, and Liberapay. It‚Äôs also in the process of finalizing a grant that will sustain Loops‚Äô development for one year. Aimed at users 13 and up, Loops will allow you to follow other users, as well as like, comment on, or share their videos. But as a part of the federated web ‚Äî the open social web running on ActivityPub ‚Äî remote users from other platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed will also be able to follow users‚Äô Loops accounts and then view the videos in their home feed on those respective platforms. These remote followers will also be able to like, comment on, or share videos if their platform supports it. Videos published to the app will be held for moderation if the uploader has a low trust score, but trusted users will be able to skip the queue and publish immediately. The trust score is also used to hide problematic comments on posts and apply content warnings, Supernault notes. Other features, like profile sharing or the ability for Loops users to follow Mastodon and Pixelfed users in return, are still ‚Äúto be announced,‚Äù the site notes. While signups for Loops are now open after a monthlong countdown period wrapped, interested testers will be emailed when it‚Äôs possible to actually start using the new app. (That might take a day or so, Supernault said, due to rate limiting.) According to Supernault, a side-loadable APK will be made available to Android users, and an iOS app will initially arrive on Apple‚Äôs TestFlight testing service when approved. A web interface won‚Äôt be an immediate focus but will come later on. Currently, the founder is also asking for community feedback on things like Loops terms and privacy policy and is searching for moderators.

a lot of people were commenting on his video about wanting to see an animated version of his story. unfortunately i cannot do that, i am simply too dumb to do that on the computer, but i did try this. i hope you all like it. if you enjoyed it or didn't enjoy it, please tell me. i like positive and negative feedback, if it's said in a nice way. 

this video is not an anime, it's a...i suppose, a slideshow.

if you want to check out etho's channel and his episode in which he tells his story, check it out here:

Description: Kurisu Makise from Steins;Gate has reappeared from the year 2038 to your current worldline. According to her, the only thing standing between CERN and total domination by their new AI system is...

A new kind of CAPTCHA.

In this video, Kurisu judges the submissions from the 2024 LaurieWired Halloween Programming Challenge. The goal of the challenge was to write and submit the code for a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that is solvable by humans but not by machines.

All programming languages were accepted. The most interesting submissions were featured :)

Description: What happens when you have a bug in your CPU?  Today we are looking at GhostWrite, a RISC-V vulnerability affecting multiple CPU vendors, particuarly related to the vector instructions.

Using some PoC code, we'll crash the system, modify a process, and even read arbitrary memory!  You can even try this yourself with my provided code + the right board.

We'll also take a look at how the CISPA researchers discovered this vulnerability via Differential Fuzzing; a fairly new technique in the CPU space.

Canada, much like the United States, is split into two halves. On the east side is Canada's major population centers of Toronto and Montreal. And on the west side are the smaller, but still large cities of Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. But separating thw the two halves is a VAST EXPANSE of almost nothing, comprising what I've termed Canada's Empty Belt. So why don't more Canadians live in this area specifically?

And then you think you got it all, and then one day two years later, you're walking barefoot and you step on a piece of broken glass and you kill yourself!

COMMUNITY POST

Regarding the last video about Nux, while I can‚Äôt be a friend after some of the recent things that surfaced, I do feel I did do an overreaction that stemmed from a being emotional on the reaction from the community on Reddit.

I‚Äôve been watching my content for the past few weeks I have realized my channel has slipped into a ‚Äúslop‚Äùchannel. I have made more drama related content over the last several months than I have fun, engaging and informative content. That includes producing videos that don‚Äôt release daily. I need to take more time and release content a couple times a week that stands in quality and not quantity.

I don‚Äôt do this for a job so honestly going out of my way to constantly chase trends has done nothing beneficial for me other than alienate my most hardcore fans.

I need to take a few days off and reset and produce better content that isn‚Äôt the latest trends or internet drama. While that produces a good view count it‚Äôs not the kind of content I want to be known for.

I‚Äôll be back. With content that I‚Äôm proud of. In regards to past collaborations all I can do is apologize and promise to do better.

This game on close inspection actually appears to steal not only assets but entrap people into a shady dealing of cryptocurrency where they'll lose not just their time but also their money. It should be shut down. Thanks for watching!

Lyrics:

It‚Äôs sunny here in the valley 
But it‚Äôs pouring rain in your dreams 
Maybe there‚Äôs something in the water making them feel out of reach 

When you‚Äôre way down 
It‚Äôs dark out 
And it feels like no one‚Äôs there with you you‚Äôre wrong
Cause I‚Äôve been here all along 

And when the roof caves in and you‚Äôre stuck in moment but 
the world keep spinning around 
I‚Äôll be with you for all it 
I‚Äôd rather be an optimist 

And If you lose your hope
I know the feeling when the world keeps counting you out 
I‚Äôll never let you fall for it 
I‚Äôd rather be an optimist 

You don‚Äôt have to rush to get there 
Don‚Äôt be afraid ask for help 
If you stand up tall 
You can break the walls 
That you built up around yourself 

When you‚Äôre way down 
It‚Äôs dark out 
And it feels like no one‚Äôs there with you your wrong
Cause I‚Äôve been here all along 

And when the roof caves in and you‚Äôre stuck in moment but 
the world keep spinning around 
Ill be with you for all it 
I‚Äôd rather be an optimist 

And If you lose your hope
I know the feeling when the world keeps counting you out 
I‚Äôll never let you fall for it 
I‚Äôd rather be an optimist 

I‚Äôd rather be a glass half full type of guy
I‚Äôd rather have the good days stuck on my mind 
I‚Äôll be with you for all of it 
I‚Äôd rather be an optimist

Hey, we're Crash Adams, two musicians who are best friends from Toronto who love to make pop/alternative music. You may have seen us doing viral stunts in the middle of the street with our red couch, to help spread our music! We produce, write, sing, mix and master all of our songs, and we love showcasing this music in a fun and humorous way through public pranks and performances in the middle of the street. We love to see how people react!

If you like musicians like Maroon 5, Harry Styles, Bruno Mars, Stellar, Imagine Dragons, Glass Animals, Benson Boone you'll love our content and music!

"Night out" by LiQWYD https://www.youtube.com/c/LiQWYD

All creators in this video have been featured in previous videos. Although, there is just simply too many creators used in this video to link every single one of them since YouTube only lets you have the description of your videos be 5000 characters long. If you want to find one of these creators, search them up either on twitch.tv or YouTube. Nametags for every creator is listed on the screen of their clip so make sure to check them out!

Please note: On Gamers React, you will discover highly edited gaming clips from streamers. Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the person‚Äôs speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube. If you have any concerns or want a clip of yours removed, please send an email at gamersreact@afkcreators.com

There's a new Discord scam that is on the loose. A captcha that hacks your computer and Discord account after you complete it. However, this captcha scam doesn't pop up only on Discord, but it shows up everywhere across the internet. So I'm going to show you how the scam works and how to identify a scam captcha.

And for the paranoid Discord users watching this, I'm going to clarify something about Discord's own captchas...

Description: Discord made a whole new feature called "Nitro Credits", where you can earn free Discord nitro. However, when it comes to Discord being generous, I get skeptical...

In this case though, these free Discord nitro credits are pretty good. They do have a pretty obvious flaw, the amount of nitro you get. But it opens the doors to a future where Discord somehow makes money while allowing us to save money by not buying nitro. All thanks to Discord's quest feature.

Hopefully there's a quest to teach people how to touch grass though.

Description: This music video was made entirely from TemuÔøº

[Verse]
Plastic keys and broken strings play the sound of paupers' kings
Empty bottles join the beat as we dance on worn-out streets
Junkyard rhythms keep us high making magic from the night
Dollar store dreams light our way in the neon city's sway

[Verse 2] (4ever)
Cardboard crowns on tangled hair we're the royals of somewhere
Rusty tins and paper cups fill the banquet of our guts
Cracked mirrors show a million smiles life's a joke but it's worthwhile
From the thrift shop to the club we find gold in grime and muck

[Chorus]
Laughing loud and running wild feeling young and being proud
Cheap thrills never cost a dime living life on borrowed time
Heartbeats echo off the walls no one cares if we trip and fall
We find love in each day's dawn in the world we built upon

[Bridge] (4ever)
Silver spoons and golden chains mean nothing in our lively lane
Freedom found in the bargain bins makes us rich in every spin
Moonlight shines on shattered glass diamonds born from human class
We know treasures are inside where the heartbeats never hide

[Verse 3]
Pavement's cold but so's our drink to the future we all clink
Broken chords and out of tune still we find our own high noon
Empty pockets but hearts full we are living contradiction's rule
Life's a stage with frayed old curtains where in rags we make our certain

[Chorus]
Laughing loud and running wild feeling young and being proud
Cheap thrills never cost a dime living life on borrowed time
Heartbeats echo off the walls no one cares if we trip and fall
We find love in each day's dawn in the world we built upon

Description: As we reach the end of 2024, we've gotta talk about the 2025 tax changes in Canada that will take effect in just a few weeks, including updated federal income tax brackets, increased RRSP and TFSA contribution limits, CPP and EI premiums going up, and the new GST/HST Holiday Tax Break. I break down everything you need to know going into the New Year in this video.

*Correction: The deadline to make a contribution to your RRSP and make it count as a deduction on your 2024 taxes is Monday, March 3, not March 1 as stated, since that day lands on a weekend).

But also... my book "Everything but Money" will hit shelves at the start of 2025, so you can either pre-order now or buy your copy when it comes out! More info: https://jessicamoorhouse.com/book

Massive thanks to the guys from Mango Hill Skirmish for letting me film their club day on January 26th, 2013. 

Go check them out at http://www.mangohillskirmish.com/index.html
They are located 25 minutes north of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

My friend David Bruggemann wrote the score for this and he did an absolutely amazing job! Go check out his facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/davidbruggemanncomposer?fref=ts
And his website:
http://davidbruggemann.com

This was shot on a Canon 5D Mark III, with a Canon 16-35mm F/2.8 L series lens.

And the smooth shots were done using a Glidecam HD 4000.

Description: TNT broke his femur on August 3.  He was put in a spica cast for what was supposed to be 6-8 weeks.  He got it off in just over 4 weeks, 5 days after the birth of our second son.  He is thrilled to be out of it and we are thrilled for him to be out of it.  Thank you to all of you who helped in some way.  Having a 21 month old in a 1/2 body cast with mom 7-8 months pregnant and unable to lift him (then with an infant) is an intimidating task, but the help we got from all of you made it a lot easier than it could have been.  
Thank you!

Description: In the 20s & 30s Deep Ellum- an area of downtown Dallas Texas was a happening area... after its heyday, it lay dormant for many years until the late 80s and early 90s when several clubs, businesses, and artists/musicians began calling it home. When I was growing up and in high school during the late 70s, only local "cover" bands could play in Dallas Fort Worth clubs. With the revitalization of Deep Ellum, the area supported artistic creativity on many levels and the music scene really took off...Theater Gallery, Prophet Bar, Trees, DaDa, etc. Enjoy the memories. This video was created way back in 1991 and was never meant to be an in depth representation of the best venues and bands. I was just out of college a couple of years at that point and just trying to build a portfolio. So I borrowed some gear and my buddy and I spent maybe 3 or 4 days shooting in the area.  Also a word of warning: please excuse the poor videotape condition and cheesy transitions- this was of course created many years ago with no budget and limited technology!

üìù Lyrics:

Well you can through any window
You say a great big beautiful world
There's an exciting adventure
Waiting for every boy and girl, but Santa

Life can be frustrating
And very confusing too, that's why
When you see a bad mood coming
You gotta catch it right from the start
That's when you gotta stop thinking
And learn to trust your heart

You need the spirit of Christmas
The spirit of Christmas (tell 'em, Santa)
Yeah, the spirit of Christmas
Never goes away
The spirit of Christmas (that's right)
The spirit of Christmas (now you got it)
The spirit of Christmas
Gonna save the day

Santa, when I was a little girl
I wrote a letter to you
I got so sad and lonely
There was nothing I could do

And I remember getting that letter
I sat down and I wrote right back
'Cause sooner or later you realise
You got to believe in yourself
If you can't change the world around
Sometimes you need a little help

You need the spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Yeah, the spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Yeah, the spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Never goes away (never goes away)
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Gonna save the day (gonna save the day)

Alright now
Let's start feeling the spirit
Just repeat after me

Gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)
We're gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)
We're gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)
We're gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)
It's alright, it's alright (it's gonna be alright)
It's alright, it's alright (it's gonna be alright)
It's gonna be alright (it's gonna be alright)
We're gonna make it alright (it's gonna be alright)

Everybody say yeah (yeah)
Everybody say yeah (yeah)
Everybody say yeah (yeah)
Everybody say yeah (yeah)

Sooner or later you realise
You got to believe in yourself
But you can't change the world alone
Sometimes you need a little help

Spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Yeah, the spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Gonna save the day (gonna save the day) sing it
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas) yeah
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
The spirit of Christmas (spirit of Christmas)
Gonna save the day, yeah (gonna save the day)
Save the day, yeah

What‚Äôs the Bruce Almighty movie about? 
Bruce Nolan‚Äôs (Jim Carrey from The Truman Show and Yes Man) career in TV has been stalled for a while, and when he‚Äôs passed over for a coveted anchorman position, he loses it, complaining that God is treating him poorly. Soon after, God (Morgan Freeman from Million Dollar Baby and Invictus) actually contacts Bruce and offers him all of his powers if he thinks he can do a better job. Bruce accepts and goes on a spree, using his new-found abilities for selfish, personal use until he realizes the prayers of the world are going unanswered.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Bruce (Jim Carrey) uses his new powers to sabotage Evan's (Steve Carell) broadcast.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After a bad day at work, a man suddenly gets a new job -- as the world's new Heavenly Father -- in this comedy. Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself (Morgan Freeman) appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against; God bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum -- he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Bruce Almighty was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
God (Morgan Freeman) tells Evan (Steve Carell) to build ark to help him change the world.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
40-Year-Old Virgin star Steve Carell reprises his role as preening newscaster Evan Baxter in this heavenly sequel to the 2003 Jim Carrey comedy hit. Shortly after television anchorman-turned-U.S. congressman Evan Baxter (Carell) relocates his family from Buffalo to Northern Virginia, God (Morgan Freeman) reveals to him that a devastating flood is coming and the planet is about to be cleansed once again. Later, when Baxter accepts the responsibility of building a great ark and his rapidly changing physical appearance begins to draw media attention, his skeptical family attempts to discern if his actions are driven by delusion or divine intervention. John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, and Molly Shannon co-star in a divine comedy of truly epic proportions.

Evan Almighty Trailer - Directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett. Buffalo newsman, Evan Baxter, is elected to congress with the slogan, "change the world." He lucks into a huge house in a new Virginia suburb. His Capitol office is also fantastic, but there's a catch: he's tapped by the powerful Congressman Long to co-sponsor a bill to allow development in national parks. In steps God appears to a disbelieving Evan and gently commands him to build an ark.

Description: "Noah's Ark - A Musical Adventure" is a fun and original take on one of the most iconic and well-known stories of all time, with an endearing combination of humor, charm, and lovable characters. The film follows two mice: Vini, a charismatic poet with terrible stage fright, and Tito, a talented and charming guitarist. When the rains come, only one male and one female of each species is allowed on Noah's Ark. With the help of an ingenious cockroach and fate's good luck, Vini and Tito sneak their way onto the Ark and together avert a showdown among the ships carnivores and plant eaters. All the while, the animals perform a series of classic songs inspired by world renowned poet, Vinicius de Moraes. Can these talented stowaways use music to break the tension and help these cooped up creatures survive the 40 days and 40 nights together? #empireentertainment #noahsark #marceloadnet

I‚Äôve wanted to make a Bardcore cover of Chappell Roan‚Äôs music since I first heard it, but that want became a need after seeing her fantasy inspired outfits at the VMAs. So I invite you to the Pink Pony Inn: a warm, raucous place where you can leave your troubles at the door and lose yourself in song and dance.  

The Art: 

I found a great source with an armored woman riding a horse, but preferred the pink horse from the next page, so I combined them and made some extensive edits.

The Lyrics:

I know thou wantest me to stay
I cannot deny these maddening visions of me in Calais 
And I heard there is a wondrous place
Where a pawn can be a queen every blessed day

I have these wicked dreams of leaving
Annecy
Oh Saint Cecelia, I swear she calleth me
Shan‚Äôt make my mother proud
The thought is too obscene
To see her darling girl
I know that she shall scream
Lord, what hast thou done?
Thou‚Äôrt a pink pony maid
Thou shouldst be a nun
Oh mother, I just want to run
With the mummers and clowns
‚ÄòTis where I belong
Down at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing, let them call it a sin
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
Pink Pony Inn

Barefoot, I spin upon the floor
Ale and mead aplenty, and a sign above the door
Firelight, and a boar‚Äôs head on the wall
Every night a new reminder why I left it all
I thank my wicked dreams, a year from
Annecy
Oh Saint Cecelia, I owe my thanks to thee
Shan‚Äôt make my mother proud
The thought is too obscene
To see her darling girl
I know that she shall scream
Lord, what hast thou done?
Thou‚Äôrt a pink pony maid
Thou shouldst be a nun
Oh mother I just want to run
With the mummers and clowns
‚ÄòTis where I belong
Down at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing, let them call it a sin
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
Pink Pony Inn

Think not, I left you all behind
Still I love my Annecy, thou‚Äôrt ever on my mind
And mother, every S√¶ternd√¶g
I can hear thy Southern lilt
Two hundred leagues away, crying
Lord, what hast thou done?
Thou‚Äôrt a pink pony maid
Thou shouldst be a nun
Oh mother I just want to run
With the mummers and clowns
‚ÄòTis where I belong
Down at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing, let them call it a sin
I shall keep on dancing at the Pink Pony Inn
Pink Pony Inn
I shall keep on dancing!
I shall keep on dancing!
I shall keep on dancing!
I shall keep on dancing!

This Xbox Hacker said he can pull up my IP Address after I confronted him for hacking the game. Other than his bluffing of being able to get my IP Address, he went on to say inappropriate stuff. His friend who was responsible for watching the BO2 infection clips was not very interactive and simply laughed while I confronted him and his friend. I decided to play some Black Ops 2 to relive some nostalgia and to see what else was new in the BO2 world. The VERY FIRST game I joined, had 2 hackers who were using the theater mode infection clip. Right off the bat, I was already pretty annoyed.

After I noticed one of the hackers jumping during the load in screen, I already knew he was going through his infection menu to ruin everyone's fun. Once I saw that, I knew he was a hacker and started recording everything. During the game, I confronted him and his friend who decided to cheat. At first, the confrontation wasn't going anywhere. Both of the hackers were in a party chat but they still heard me in game chat, calling them out. During the second game, I confrotned them again which simply resulted in my console getting frozen. Since I was playing on the Xbox Series X and not the Xbox 360, the game simply froze while I was able to restart it using the Series X. If I was using my Xbox 360, my whole console would've been frozen/bricked by the hackers.

I rejoined their session in progress to confront them again. It resulted in me getting kicked many times and my game being frozen/bricked. Since getting kicked results in being banned from the whole game session, I decided to wait it out and review the evidence I had so far. During that time, one of the hackers sent me a party invite. I started recording again to confront them and see what they had to say. SirMeliodas was not very social and chose to remain silent. His little hacking friend, FizzyVoice was more social and explained that he only hacks because it makes people mad. But that is not a good excuse for modifying game content and ruining the game for every other player. He ended saying that hell pull up my IP Address which was bogus because he never did. He was simply using an infection menu on BO2, I knew he wasn't going to be able to do much besides call me ethnic slurs and derogatory terms.

These hackers seemed comfortable with the fact that they were caught hacking. After all, one of them said they don't care. Little did they know, they were being recorded.

Are you helping scammers to get better at scamming? - https://youtu.be/B6EW8DSJvaE?t=812
Why not tell the scammers to deduct the fee from the prize? - https://youtu.be/crF88WptBkc?t=793
Who is John Warosa/Barosa? - https://youtu.be/crF88WptBkc?t=951
Did you steal your script, or steal or the idea of scambaiting from someone else? https://youtu.be/b1Q9rgzv9ZU?t=339
Why don't you make more/only scambaiting videos? https://youtu.be/W0ERK20mLgw?t=808

Description: World's Most creative Careless driving TV Ads commercials

The  best road safety commercials must watch for everyone..
Texting has become a social norm since the early 2000s because of the popularity of smartphones.[3] There have been many studies that have linked texting while driving to be the cause of life-threatening accidents due to driver distraction. The International Telecommunication Union states that "texting, making calls, and other interaction with in-vehicle information and communication systems while driving is a serious source of driver distraction and increases the risk of traffic accidents". There are about 1.6 million crashes in the US every year involving cell phone use, of which 500,000 cause injuries and 6,000 cause fatalities. Texting while driving is now the top cause of death among teenagers‚Äîtexting and driving accounts for 11 teen deaths every day in the US. Overall, texting is involved in about 25% of all car accidents in the US.

Does Google and Facebook listen in and record conversations and audio even when they're not open? I perform a live test using Google chrome on a Windows 10 PC to discover whether my microphone appears to be recording me even when my browser is turned off in order to better target advertisements. 

As pointed out in the comments, there are too many flaws in my methodology to draw any conclusions (for instance I am live streaming directly to YouTube which of course necessitates recording my microphone the whole time).

Google CEO Sundar Pichai was brought in for a hearing with members of Congress about political bias in search results. But as the hearing went on, Congress members including Rep. Ted Poe, Rep. Lamar Smith, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, Rep. Steve King, and Rep. Steve Cohen have no idea how the Internet and technology works. They asked about movement tracking, political bias in search results, how Donald Trump's image became associated with a search of the word 'idiot,' unrelated issues with the iPhone, manipulating search, an online school, and more.

LYRICS:

It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

I'm clich√©, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air

Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
You know I hate to say it, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THE ADS I COME ACROSS IN THIS VIDEO VIA FACEBOOK ARE VETTED BY ME. I SIMPLY CAME ACROSS THEM AND THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO PROMOTE THEM.

Today, I'm going on FACEBOOK and FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE and clicking as many scam ads as I can find. Many of these are actually just pop ups that lead you down a rabbit hole to download unrecognized programs that are intended to harm your privacy and computer itself. At the end, I ran a scan to see how bad my computer got infected. This is a little stress test on facebook's ad system. I also messaged with scammers selling quite niche services on marketplace. Not sure exactly what their intentions were to be honest. I hope you enjoyed the video! Please drop a like and a comment, it would be greatly appreciated! :D

Description: Please check your server perms...

Because months ago Discord gave people a new way to raid servers and to send scam messages. People use a Discord bot to spam channels or send scam messages. However, if you try to ban the bot, it doesn't work. You don't even know who sent the Discord scam either.

But there is a way to both remove these bots from your server and see who's behind the messages.
(and for you nerdy Discord users, you already know what's happening. But this is a PSA :) )

Description: Keith Wong plays Minecraft Survival 1.21 Java Edition and he talks about his experience with streaming vs editing youtube videos. 

He feels as with streaming, it is a different live experience with the chat however, it doesn't entice him because he has low attention span from YouTube shorts and tiktoks. 

With YouTube, it can be highly edited with lots of transitions which may off put people. 

Still, he prefers YouTube videos because its something to put on while he eats in the background. It also waste less time because its edited videos jampacked into a few minutes. 

Let me know what you guys think, and give me suggestions to talk about

Apparently as an adult you have to pay for lots of insurance. I have car insurance, renters insurance, health insurance, the list goes on. It's 3am typing this description. How is your day going? Mine is going pretty well despite the fact that I have no other videos planned and need to make more videos. I live in Chicago now. If you are a bad ting who lives in Chicago hit me up on Instagram and I will ignore you. I put my life savings into a Solana coin called "chadcat" and I am deeply regretting it. I bought at the all time high and it's looking like I am going to have to sell low. I also bought fart coin and sigma coin. I love buying very sketchy cryptocurrencies. It fills me with thrill. Why have you read this far? Why am I still typing? If anyone has a spare supercharger kit for a C8 corvette hit me up. Willing to pay with a firm handshake and thoughts and prayers.

Description: Andrew Tate's "The Real World" online university / Discord clone just got hacked by Andrew Tate's biggest rivals... LGBT hackers.

Not only did 14GBs of public and private messages get leaked for anyone to download, but Andrew Tate's servers got raided with tons of emojis and people being timed out until 2050 by the hackers. 

While this is funny, this hack is bigger than you think... Not only does this data pose a risk for the users of "The Real World", but it poses a potential risk for Andrew Tate himself. And as time progresses, we will see this leaked data manifest into bigger stories.

Description: Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre challenged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the real size of the federal deficit, suggesting that Trudeau ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know‚Äù what the federal budget deficit was in 2023.

Poilievre pointed to a report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) that said the federal government‚Äôs projected deficit exceeded the Liberals‚Äô promised $40 billion cap in the 2023-24 fiscal year.

‚ÄúMister Speaker, he doesn‚Äôt know. I was tempted to accuse him of hiding it, but as Napoleon Bonaparte said: ‚ÄòNever attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúMr. Speaker, who‚Äôs actually running this government?‚Äù

Trudeau did not answer Poilievre‚Äôs question about the budget but said he was ‚Äúfocused on Canadians.‚Äù

Description: Justin Trudeau spends billions and billions of your tax dollars on nonsense. 

But just a few years ago, he spent 9 million dollars on a cricket farm... Crickets... for you to eat.

This is part of their wacko environmental agenda. The press release talked about how this would provide low-cost food for Canadians... by making you eat bugs.

So let me get this straight: he's imposing a carbon tax and a fertilizer ban, both of which make meat more expensive, and then using those tax dollars he's taken from you to pay for a cricket farm for human consumption?

This is absurd. 

 Watch to the very end, because there is a bit of ASMR that you'll love.

Description: Within Canada, 4 of the nation's largest lakes mysteriously occur along a straight line. I am not referring to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, but rather even larger lakes such as the Great Bear Lake and Lake Winnipeg. There is a geologic reason why the Great Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake, Lake Winnipeg, and Lake Athabasca occur along a straight line. This fact relates to a geologic area known as the Canadian Shield, which will be discussed in this video.

Description: After U.S. president-elect Donald Trump proposed a 25-per cent tariff on all items coming into the United States once he takes office in January, debate was heated during question period in the House of Commons of Tuesday as both the Conservatives and the NDP pressured Justin Trudeau‚Äôs Liberal government to respond.

‚ÄúWe need a plan for economy and security that puts Canada first,‚Äù demanded Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre adding that the ‚Äúradical liberalization of drugs that have killed people and now threaten ours borders‚Ä¶ no plan to cancel the tax increases that will drive billions and many jobs away.‚Äù

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said ‚ÄúDonald Trump's threats of tariffs could threaten hundreds of thousands of Canadians mortgage paying jobs. The only thing a bully responds to is strength. So where's our plan to fight back?‚Äù

Trudeau responded saying ‚ÄúRather than panicking, we're engaging in constructive ways to protect Canadian jobs like we have before. I don't think the idea of going to war with the United States is what anyone wants.‚Äù

on JackSucksAtGeography we upload a range of easy to watch geography related games. We mainly play Sporcle games like "naming all 197 countries". I successfully learned all 197 countries and plan to learn more Geography trivia. On this channel I also play Geoguessr. This is a game that uses Google Street View to drop you in a random location and you have to work out exactly where you are on the worldwide map. Geoguessr was created in 2013.

Description: UPDATE (2024-08-12): The program used in this video is supposedly getting people shadow banned and has since been archived. HOWEVER, there is a new program that utilizes the Streamlabs API, and this one *should* be safe to use. You do *not* need to use Streamlabs OBS.

üìå Get it here: https://github.com/Loukious/StreamLabsTikTokStreamKeyGenerator

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE (2024-07-31): The GitHub has been archived. TikTok is aggressively going after *every* streaming method that is NOT TikTokLive Studio. Apparently even with a legitimate stream key, OBS streams are being crushed in the algorithm. I cannot confirm whether this tool works anymore, and supposedly TikTok is restricting streams that use this tool, so it's probably not even worth using anymore.

My recommendation is to either apply for an agency OR just give up on TikTok altogether.

This is no ordinary Minecraft video. Hardcore Minecraft is difficult, and Minecraft SMPs are fun.. but I returned to Minecraft Beta! 

Thank you to LDShadowLady for the inspiration behind the "fast forward" segments!

If you see this, reply DIAMONDS! 

Enjoy the video gamers :)

Description: Is Justin Trudeau's $250 rebate check really just a distraction? In this revealing video, we explore how this temporary holiday tax break coincides with his increase in the Carbon Tax. Canadians see through these cheap tactics and recognize them as a desperate ploy to buy votes. With just days before Christmas, saving $2 on a Christmas tree isn't what Canadians want; they want an election, NOW!

Description: When was the last time you posted on Facebook? Not marketplace. Not your aunt's birthday. A real post.

Because here's what's wild - Facebook has over 3 billion monthly active users, record profits, and it‚Äôs still growing every quarter... but it doesn't feel the same, does it? 

Just like Facebook's slow decline from cultural phenomenon to utility platform, Google might be facing its biggest existential threat since... well, since Google killed Yahoo. 

Despite record profits and market dominance, signs of Google's weakening grip on search are everywhere: Gen Z is abandoning it for TikTok, ChatGPT is reaching unprecedented traffic numbers, and users are increasingly frustrated with ad-cluttered, SEO-manipulated search results. 

Today we're diving deep into how AI-powered alternatives could finally crack Google's 25-year monopoly on search, and why this transition might happen faster than most people expect.

It's taken decades for Toronto to get a new downtown subway, but the Ontario Line actually looks pretty good - all things considered. It'll be delayed and over budget, but we'll forget about all of that as soon as it's up and running :^) 

Another huge thank you to Jonathan English and the numerous others who helped out behind the scenes. A lot of the early parts of this video were based off Jonathan's dissertation - great read if you want more Toronto transit history: https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-d999-t426

Description: Ontarians have been tricked ‚Äì the public has been misled. Drivers are going to suffer, people on bicycles are going to suffer, transit users are going to suffer‚Ä¶ EVERYONE in Ontario, Canada is going to suffer because of Bill 212. But all that anyone's been talking about are bike lanes. 

I only counted ‚Äúbicycles‚Äù being mentioned like‚Ä¶ 10 times in ALL of Bill 212. And Highway 413 was mentioned OVER 90 TIMES. This video looks over these important documents which will determine Ontario's ‚Äì and ever Canada's ‚Äì future.

Doug Ford‚Äôs Reducing Gridlock and Saving You Time Act (Bill 212) is rushing Highway 413 into development. While it promises to reduce traffic congestion, internal reports and transportation experts disagree. The highway could cost over $10 billion, pave through protected greenbelt lands. Worse yet, the bill introduces new hurdles for municipalities to build bike lanes, prioritizing cars over sustainable transportation.

Video breakdown:
- The real cost of Highway 413 to taxpayers ü§ë
- Why more highways don‚Äôt solve traffic congestion üö¶
- Environmental impacts üåé
- How Bill 212 restricts bike lane development üö≤
- What history tells us about Ontario's highway projects, from 401 to 407.

****
From a production standpoint, I'm aware there could be more B-Roll, less detail and more conciseness to this, but I'm currently up to my eyeballs in projects. This video just needed to get and into the world because it's legitimately critical for everyone to understand. We'll see what the reception is like, but no matter what happens, at least I tried my best to spread the information. Cheers! -Ben

Description: Jamaica (and much of the Caribbean) were offered numerous chances to join Canada. As you'll know, none of them did. So why not? Why did Jamaica turn down the opportunity to be a Canadian Province? It's because they were sick of other people telling them what to do.

Description: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has built his reputation as an outspoken critic of the Canadian federal Liberal government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 

Now, the party is trying to showcase Poilievre's softer side, looking to capitalize on the Conservatives‚Äô growing lead over the Liberals in the polls. 

Mackenzie Gray explains how Poilievre's family is a part of this advertising blitz and the key voters being pursued.

‚ÄúYears And Years - Breathe (Olly Alexander)‚Äù Lyrics

[Refrain]
What's that supposed to be about, baby?
Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy
Reminiscing on the good times daily
Try and pull that, got me actin shady
What's that supposed to be about, baby?
Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy
You know I give you that good loving daily
Try and pull that, got me actin shady

[Verse 1]
You say you love me, say you love me
But you're never there for me
Yeah, uh
And you'll be crying, slowly dying, when I decide to leave
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
All we do is make up, then break up
Why don't we wake up and see when love hurts, it won't work?
Yeah, maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

[Refrain]
What's that supposed to be about, baby?
Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy
Reminiscing on the good times daily
Try and pull that, got me actin shady

[Verse 2]
You're only lonely when your homie ain't got a ride or no loot
Yeah, uh
Then comes the drama
Some motha calling's, claiming she's going out with you
Mmmm

[Chorus]
All we do is make up, then break up
Why don't we wake up and see when love hurts, oh, it won't work?
Yeah, maybe we need some time alone
We need to let it breathe

[Break]
We need to let it breathe
Mmm, we need to let it breathe, mmm, oh

[Refrain]
What's that supposed to be about, baby?
Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy
Reminiscing on the good times daily
Try and pull that, got me actin shady
What's that supposed to be about, baby?
Go free up your vibe, stop acting crazy
You know I give you that good loving daily
Try and pull that, got me actin shady

[Breakdown]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, we need to let it breathe
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, we need to let it breathe

[Outro]
You say that you love me, that you love me
But you're never there for me
Hmm
And you'll be crying, slowly dying, when I decide to leave, uh
Oh, we need to let it breathe

Description: A mapping error has left this American city to be controlled by Canada. The Northwest Angle (Angle Inlet) - that small bit that sticks out of Northern Minnesota - exists because of an accident made by map makers before the United States border was established. Today, residents are essentially controlled by the Canadian government. In order for people who live in the Northwest Angle to travel to the rest of the continental US they've had to cross into Canada and go through customs. For many people this has meant four border crossings a day. The inconvenience has even prompted residents to create a 37 mile long ice road across Lake of the Woods. Due to severe weather this year, however, that passage was shut down. The community there has had enough, and some are ready to take a stand.

Description: Canada is a nation blessed with significant geopolitical advantages but grappling with considerable internal challenges.

In this video, we take a closer look at the distinct cultural identities across its provinces, unpack the complexities of its resource-dependent economy, and scrutinize the controversial decisions made by its leaders. From housing crises to political scandals, this episode uncovers the intricate web of issues that could shape Canada's future and its relationship with the wider world.

Join us as we explore how Canada's dwindling population, soaring cost of living, and contentious leadership might be sowing seeds of division within this vast and diverse country.

Channel Name: The Drive
Description: Speed limits are the most commonly broken law in America. Not only that, they're actually going UP over time. What gives? This week we're diving into the truth about speed limits‚Äîand why an American Autobahn can't happen.

Of course, speed limits for surface streets in cities and towns make sense. No one wants someone ripping a 90-mph drift through their neighborhood. But when you look at major routes and highways, the way speed limits are set can cause more harm than good.

That's because speed limits are determined and periodically updated via something called the 85th percentile rule, where engineers calculate the max speed at which 85% of drivers are traveling on a given road and make that the limit. But if more than half of Americans speed, that means limits continue to rise as regular traffic studies are done. 

This also increases the real risk factor in speeding: speed variability, or the difference in speed between you, other cars, pedestrians, and stationary objects. Higher speed variability in traffic means more congestion, more road rage, and more risk of a crash.

That's why, among other things, the answer isn't just to get rid of speed limits. Instead, we need to rethink how they're calculated, applied, and enforced.

Description: North Korea is the most interesting and isolated country in the world, so I went to the border town with China to investigate what is going on.  I often think about my trip to Pyongyang, North Korea back in April 2017 - it was a completely bizarre experience.  All Americans are banned from going back, so for now, this is the closest I could get to stepping foot on North Korean soil.

If you ever got the chance, would you visit North Korea? Comment below and share your thoughts!

#pot #22minutes #comedy

TRANSCRIPT: 

Even thought cannabis is legal in Canada, if
you're carrying pot when you enter the country,

you must declare it at the border, otherwise
you may face arrest and possibly criminal prosecution.

[car honks]

Where are you coming from?

Vermont.

What?

We don't have any pot to declare like at all so
like, no point even lookin'.

Papers.

Passports.

Reason for visiting the states.

I was visiting my friend.

And who are you?

I'm the friend.

We were both looking for me but I was in the
car the whole time so we couldn't find me.

What's with the smoke?

Uh.

[same time] Pot. Muffler.

Did you buy any cigarettes?

No, smoking is gross.

Then why do you have so many lighters?

Uh cuz we really like slow songs at concerts?

I'm gonna ask you guys a couple of questions,
ok?

What's eight times nine?

Eighty-nine.

What's fifteen percent of a forty dollar bill?

Too much?

How many grams are in an eighth?

Three and a half.

How many grams are in a quarter ounce?

Seven.

And how much is an ounce?

This much?

I'm gonna have to confiscate that.

Oh man.

That's like drug abuse.

Dude, how did you even know we were high!

You told me you drove in from Vermont.

Yeah...

This is the Canadian side.

[both start laughing]

[voiceover] Weed is legal in Canada, so you

really don't have any good reason to leave.

A message from the Canada Border Services
Agency.

Description: The Huge Conversation with Mark Zuckerberg...

I interviewed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg before Connect. There are not many people with more power over our future. Right now, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are imagining the future billions of people might live in, soon, and building towards it. So, in this conversation, my goal is to figure out what that future looks like. To paint a picture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying to build, so that you can decide for yourself what you think of it.

We talked about the Meta's new Orion prototype AR glasses, creating holograms and the Star Trek universal translator, generative AI changing social media, big trends in human connection, open sourced AI, Ray Ban Meta glasses and Quest 3S, the biggest genuine question on his mind right now, and more... 

Welcome to the first episode of our new series, Huge Conversations‚Ä¶

Special thanks to Derek Thompson, for his generous guidance on my first long-form interview!

Chapters: 
0:00 What is Mark Zuckerberg trying to build?
2:08 Meta's new Orion prototype AR glasses
4:42 How do Meta's Orion glasses work?
6:55 What's the future of AR?
9:50 What's the future of VR?
11:36 What is Meta trying to build?
13:18 Haptics is hard
17:18 Why does VR feel real?
20:16 Why are we having trouble connecting?
24:27 What should we use AI for?
28:17 What wouldn't he want his kids using AI for?

Get your LARQ water bottle here with discounts up to 30% off: https://bylarq.com/Cleo 

Have you ever thought, ‚Äúwhat if I just dug a really really deep hole?‚Äù

Well, the USSR actually did. The hole they dug is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean. It‚Äôs deeper than Mt. Everest is tall! They began digging it in the 1970s as part of a space race, but down. The United States only got to 600 ft before pulling funding. But the USSR kept going for 20 years. They made it about a third of the way through the Earth‚Äôs crust and then STOPPED.

But what if‚Ä¶ you just‚Ä¶ kept... digging? 

If you dug a hole to the center of the Earth, what would you find? What would happen to you? And what does our newest tech tell us is REALLY down below your feet?

In this video, we‚Äôre going on a journey to the center of the Earth‚Ä¶

Chapters: 
0:00 What if you dug a hole to Earth‚Äôs core?
1:05 What happens when I start digging?
1:36 What are the deepest made-made things?
2:25 What is the deepest hole humans ever dug?
3:03 What happens in the mantle?
3:45 Why is the Earth hot?
4:38 What did we used to think was inside the Earth?
5:06 How do we know what‚Äôs inside the Earth??
5:59 What‚Äôs inside the core?
6:26 Um, the magnetic field switches direction??
7:13 Why is the Earth in layers?
8:53 What‚Äôs at the center of the Earth?
9:46 Earth‚Äôs core spins at its own rate??
10:52 What don‚Äôt we know?

Description: The real science of puppy aging
Subscribe to support optimistic science and tech videos!

Meet Thor. He‚Äôs a 10-pound Australian Shepherd and, objectively, the cutest dog to ever live (except yours, of course). Thor is 8 years old, which means that he is likely about halfway through his life. I on the other hand am probably about a third of the way through mine. I hate that math. It seems cruel that we live so much longer than our best friends.

What can we do to help dogs live longer? That‚Äôs where this video begins. Along the way, my research took me on a journey to better understand what aging is, human and dog longevity research, how dogs and humans age differently, and why ‚Äúdog years‚Äù aren't real. I met Celine Halioua, founder of a company called Loyal, which is conducting large-scale dog longevity research. And I spent some quality time with Thor.

But the best part of this video is that YOU submitted your dog videos and photos! This video is dedicated to your dogs: Poppy, Cleo (oh, hey!), Alexa, Pickles, Bree, Tuffy, Whitey, Dakota, Callan, Annie, Lonzo, Belle, Momo, Nelson, Yolie, Achilles, Yondu, Jasper, Ginny, Arya, Goldie, Macho, Mochi, Bombon, Pepe, Cheeseburger (omg), Ellie, Hagrid, Leia, Mosley, Chillie, Mery, Azure, Data, Luna, Dobby, Ketch, Sem, Hershey, Kobe, Penny, Ari, Lou, Browser, Molly, Pia, Jack, Pocky, Alphonse, Banjo, Sandy, Simba, Maha, Chip, Titus, Dougal, Apollo, Lucky, Mister, Mouse, King, Meda, Yoshi, Bacon, Mia, Sherry, and Macy. We love you.  (Please let me know if you submitted but don‚Äôt see your dog‚Äôs name here! I‚Äôll add them.)

00:00 How can I help my dog live longer?
01:11 What are dog years?
02:29 How do you measure aging?

Google Trends provides weekly relative search interest for every search term, along with the interest by state. Using these two datasets for each term, we're able to calculate the relative search interest for every state for a particular week. Linear interpolation was used to calculate the daily search interest.

Description: Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time I wanted to focus on the growing trend of digital ID access on the Internet when it comes to certain laws creeping into numerous world governments. It's a trend that honestly worries me when maintaining a free and open Internet and the growing requirement by leaders to require your ID sent off for verification purposes to access parts of the Internet should not be normalized.

Channel Name: Global News
Description: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is vowing to ‚Äúfight fire with fire‚Äù and address U.S. president-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs economic protectionism with policies aimed at attracting investment and higher wages in Canada.

Poilievre told Jas Johal on Corus Radio station CKNW in Vancouver on Friday he also supports increased security at the U.S.-Canada border, but downplayed fears that Trump‚Äôs promised mass deportations will lead to an influx of migrants seeking to enter Canada. Corus Entertainment is the parent company of Global News.

Johal asked how Poilievre would plan to deal with Trump if he imposed tariffs on Canada, as he‚Äôs promised a blanket 10-per cent tariff on all foreign imports to the U.S.

‚ÄúFirst of all, we should be exempt from all these tariffs. I can‚Äôt believe that (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau signed a trade deal with Trump that leaves open the possibility of a 10-per cent tariff. I never would have agreed to that,‚Äù Poilievre said. ‚ÄúBut more importantly, I‚Äôll fight fire with fire.‚Äù

WiFi hacking is very much still a thing performed by both white hat and black hat hackers. In this video, NetworkChuck will demonstrate how hackers might hack a wifi network from three different levels or perspectives, a Noob, Hipster and Pro. All of the wireless attacks demonstrated in this video are real and possible. The purpose of this video is NOT to equip an army of skiddies but to educate people on how WiFi hacks occur and what they can do to protect themselves and the networks they run. In this video, NetworkChuck will demonstrate man-in-the-middle attacks, evil twin attacks, arp spoofing, dns spoofing and wifi password cracking.

LYRICS:
you broke me first 
maybe you don‚Äôt like talking too much about yourself 
but you shoulda told me that you were thinking bout someone else 
you‚Äôre drunk at a party or maybe it‚Äôs just that your car broke down 
or your phone‚Äôs been off for a couple months, so you‚Äôre calling me now 

i know you, you‚Äôre like this 
when shit don‚Äôt go your way you needed me to fix it 
and like me, i did 
but i ran out of every reason 

now suddenly you‚Äôre asking for it back 
could you tell me where‚Äôd you get the nerve 
ya, you could say you miss all that we had 
but i don‚Äôt really care how bad it hurts 
when you broke me first 

took a while, was in denial when i first heard 
that you moved on quicker than i coulda ever 
you know that hurt 
swear for a while i would stare at my phone just to see your face 
but now that it‚Äôs there, i don‚Äôt really know what to say 

i know you, you‚Äôre like this 
when shit don‚Äôt go your way you needed me to fix it 
and like me, i did 
but i ran out of every reason 

now suddenly you‚Äôre asking for it back 
could you tell me where‚Äôd you get the nerve 
ya, you could say you miss all that we had 
but i don‚Äôt really care how bad it hurts 
when you broke me first 

what did you think would happen? 
what did you think would happen? 
i‚Äôll never let you have it
what did you think would happen? 

now suddenly you‚Äôre asking for it back 
could you tell me where‚Äôd you get the nerve 
ya, you could say you miss all that we had 
but i don‚Äôt really care how bad it hurts 
when you broke me first

Description: Get ready to craft your world. #MinecraftMovie - only in theaters 2025.

From Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù directed by Jared Hess, is the first-ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time.  

The film also stars Emma Myers (‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (‚ÄúThe Color Purple‚Äù), Sebastian Hansen (‚ÄúJust Mercy, ‚ÄúLisey‚Äôs Story‚Äù), with Jennifer Coolidge.

Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn‚Äôt just help you craft, it‚Äôs essential to one‚Äôs survival!  Four misfits‚ÄîGarrett ‚ÄúThe Garbage Man‚Äù Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)‚Äîfind themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.  To get back home, they‚Äôll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).  Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative‚Ä¶the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world. 

Oscar nominee Hess (‚ÄúNinety-Five Senses,‚Äù ‚ÄúNacho Libre‚Äù) directed, with Roy Lee, Jon Berg, Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Jason Momoa, Jill Messick, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Vu Bui producing, and Todd Hallowell, Kayleen Walters, Brian Mendoza, Jonathan Spaihts, Pete Chiappetta, Andrew Lary and Anthony Tittanegro executive producing.

The director‚Äôs creative team behind the camera includes BAFTA-nominated director of photography Enrique Chediak (‚Äú127 Hours,‚Äù ‚ÄúTransformers: Rise of the Beasts‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Grant Major (‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Meg‚Äù), editor James Thomas (‚ÄúPok√©mon: Detective Pikachu‚Äù, the ‚ÄúBorat‚Äù films), Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dan Lemmon (‚ÄúThe Jungle Book,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Batman‚Äù), and costume designer Amanda Neale (‚ÄúThe Meg,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat We Do in the Shadows‚Äù).  Casting is by Rachel Tenner.  The music supervisors are Gabe Hilfer and Karyn Rachtman, and the music is by Mark Mothersbaugh (‚ÄúThor: Ragnarok,‚Äù the ‚ÄúLEGO¬Æ‚Äù movies).

Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present A Vertigo Entertainment/On The Roam/Moj√§ng Aktiebolag Production, A Jared Hess Film, ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie.‚Äù  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures worldwide and by Legendary East in China, and released only in theaters and IMAX in North America on April 4, 2025, and internationally beginning 2 April 2025.

Description: Discord might be getting rid of 3 badges, and I already know this is going to be the 9/11 for Discord badge goblins.

However, that's only one small part of this Discord news recap. Discord is also working on a new scam feature that should prevent scams..... and at the same time make new ones! Discord's Quests/ads feature also got a dystopian upgrade that forces you to watch their new video ads.

And the cherry on top of this all is that another Discord user went to jail...

BOOTING FROM A USB DRIVE
Exactly how you boot from a USB drive does I‚Äôm afraid depend on your particular computer. Often a boot menu can be accessed by pressing a particular key when you power-on, which may be F12, F11, F10 or Esc. And if you can bring up such a menu, you can simply select the USB drive.

Alternatively, you can enter the BIOS/UEFI, again by pressing an appropriate key, which is commonly F2, Delete or Esc. Once in the BIOS you can hopefully find a setting that will change the boot order to have USB first, so that your computer will always first try to boot from an inserted USB drive. However, to work, this may also require you to disable a feature called ‚ÄúSecure Boot‚Äù, which you may then have turn on again to allow Windows to boot on your PC (it depends on the version). However, once in the BIOS, there is often an ‚ÄúExit‚Äù or similar menu (usually on the end on the right) that offers a ‚Äúboot override‚Äù facility. And this allows you to select to boot from a USB drive without having to make any BIOS changes. So here you would select your inserted USB drive, and your computer would then happily boot from it.

Sadly, UEFI/BIOS settings and USB boot configurations are just not standardized, so I cannot give you a definitive set of instructions here! But I do provide more guidance in my video on ‚ÄúPC BIOS Settings‚Äù: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezubjTO7rRI

Thanks to @MarkRober and the robot teams for making this video with me!

Neo is a REAL robot! As a disclaimer, it can operate and do many actions on its own but some of the specialized actions in this video were 'remotely controlled' by a robot using a VR headset (since it is not yet specifically trained to cook), and the robot's voice works using Open AI software.

Description: MrWhoseTheBoss is an awesome tech YouTuber, and he leaned into his tech-side over the course of a 100-day body transformation. I thought it would be fun to review his lifestyle changes with the same concentration and respect he uses to reviews new gear. We talk about diet changes, such as reducing calories, adjusting caffeine intake, tossing our candy/snacks for more whole fruits and vegetables, and so much more. We also talked about his exercise changes, such as running, walking at night, and a major uptick in weight lifting. There were a bunch of other pieces of wellness gear and lifestyle changes, like shock belts, meditation, and various apps on his phone. As I always tell my patient, long-term, consistent lifestyle changes are the keys to success!

This video is MUCH longer that I initally thought it would be, and acts almost as if it were a full on review of Linux as an operating system from the perspective of someone who makes YouTube videos. Honestly, I had alot of fun making something like this, as its a pretty big departure from alot of my other gaming videos, and lets me knuckle down a bit more and get some more serious work done than just making a highlights video, which I still love doing btw!

Anyway, I talk about pretty much everything from installing Linux, some Linux distributions, OBS recording, Desktop Environments, Editing using KDEN Live or Davinci Resolve, and even talk a bit about making thumbnails in Photopea. I tried my best to cover every aspect of making a video for YouTube in order to find why people don't use this operating system outside of its small niche. And to make certain that I didn't miss anything, I edited this ENTIRE video in Linux, from start to finish, just to prove a point.

Now that this great big long project is done, I'll finally be starting to edit through some stream highlights and get back to uploading more gaming content, this time around I'll be diversifying a little bit more than solely Lethal Company, although I'll still be playing some soon!

Description: Video Game Preservation has been in the news recently with the US Copyright Office just striking down an effort to make it easier to preserve and play legacy video games. Many in the industry say that more needs to be done but is it just talk? The ESA along with game publishers don't seem to be interesting in preserving video games at all. This is why me, you - the community - need to take charge and do it ourselves. We discuss the complex landscape of Video Game Preservation, Piracy and Emulation in today's episode.


This video is for entertainment purposes only. The video is not meant to promote software piracy in anyway. You're an adult, make good choices.

Description: I always knew that Red Bull did some insane stunts but I never knew about all the ones I mention in this video, did you?? I can't believe that even though I spend my life looking at a screen, I never once came across this until now. They have done so many stunts that it hurts my brain, I know I must have missed some other crazy ones so let me know your favorites in the comments below!

Description: Ever wondered what it would be like to live in a small society isolated from "the real world"? Just imagine, living in the middle of nowhere in motorhomes, with mothers teaching you who barely got an education themselves, struggling in poverty. I feel really bad for everyone involved with Tom Green and hope they are doing well. 

Thank you everyone for all of the support! Anything you do, liking, subscribing, commenting, really helps out the algorithm so that more people can find me! Each view and subscriber is one more closer to me getting a new mic :')

Side note, this is NOT an anti-polygamy video. Although I definitely do condemn these types of polygamy, as a child CANNOT consent to being married, period. Adults who consent (not manipulated into) in choosing to do polygamy or polyamory is cool beans if it works for them.

Description: Have you noticed changes at Tim Hortons? From longer wait times to lower food and coffee quality, something just isn't the same. In this video, we explore the rise and fall of this iconic Canadian coffee chain.


We‚Äôll look at the history of Tim Hortons, including its humble beginnings, the introduction of famous items like Timbits, and how corporate mergers with Wendy‚Äôs and Burger King impacted the brand. We‚Äôll also dive into the controversies, such as cost-cutting, declining customer service, and changes to traditions like Roll Up the Rim.

In all honesty, having an ultimate tech house is pretty nice. However there's one aspect of my home that has been left, well, in the dark. So in today's video, with the help of Homey, we switched over my light switches to Innovelli. And I think it's time to see things in a new light.

Description: Walk #11
September 8th, 2023

Morning walk in Victoria Park, Kitchener Ontario. 

Victoria Park opened in 1896, making it KW's oldest park. Some of the original features remain, including an iron bridge, flower beds and hundreds of trees and shrubs. The park is also home to a historic pavilion, which is a popular event and wedding venue.

Please be warned that the video contains sounds of loud horns, traffic, and some very loud Canada geese :)  Depending on who you are you might find relaxing, but I'm aware that some hate it. 

Either way, hope you enjoy it!

Description: Are you considering moving to Kitchener, Ontario? While the city may seem like a great 
place to call home, there are some dark sides that you should be aware of before making 
a final decision. In this YouTube video, we will explore 5 reasons to think twice before 
moving to Kitchener, Ontario.

‚úÖ-Harsh Winter Weather: Kitchener experiences cold and snowy winters, which can be 
      a challenge for those who are not used to extreme weather conditions. This can make 
     it difficult to get around and can also lead to seasonal affective disorder for some 
     individuals.

‚úÖ- No Lake Waters: Kitchener is located in Southern Ontario, which is known for its many 
       lakes and waterways, the city itself does not have a lake. However, nearby cities such 
       as Cambridge and Waterloo do have access to lakes and rivers.

‚úÖ-Lack Of Public Transport: Kitchener, Ontario has a bus system operated by Grand River 
      Transit, but it can be limited and infrequent in some areas, particularly outside of peak 
      hours. This can make it challenging for individuals who rely on public transportation.  
      
‚úÖ-Traffic Congestion: Kitchener is known for its heavy traffic congestion, particularly during 
       rush hour. This can make commuting to and from work a frustrating and time-consuming
      experience.

‚úÖ-No Night Parties or Clubs: Kitchener, Ontario does have some nightlife options, but there 
      are fewer options than in larger cities. While there are bars and pubs, there are no nightclubs 
      in Kitchener, and the nightlife scene tends to be more low-key. This may be a downside for
     individuals who are looking for a more vibrant and active nightlife experience.

Overall, while Kitchener may have its positive aspects, it's important to consider the 
potential drawbacks before making a decision to move. Watch our video to learn more 
about the dark side of Kitchener, Ontario.

If you‚Äôre thinking about moving to Kitchener Ontario Canada be sure to give me a call, 
shoot me a text, send me an email, or schedule a Zoom call. I‚Äôd love to help you make a 
smooth move to Kitchener Ontario!

Five years later, we did another video tour of downtown Kitchener - things have changed since 2017! You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/PSCGikvj_lA

A drive through downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada on August 8, 2017. Starting on Victoria Street, we turn left on King Street, traveling the length of downtown before turning right on Madison Ave. and right again on Charles Street to travel back to Victoria Street. We then turn right onto Duke Street to complete the tour.

Kitchener, Ontario is a city located 100 kilometres west of Toronto. Now the seat of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Kitchener was founded in 1833 and incorporated as the town of Berlin in 1853. Incorporation as a city came in 1912 and the Berlin name stuck until 1916.

The population of Kitchener is 233,000 (up from 150,000 in 1986) and the metro population is around 525,000 with that number including Waterloo and Cambridge.

Seen throughout the video is the Grand River Transit's Light Rail Transit line. This system of electric trains is slated to start operation in 2018. The downtown portion looks to be mostly complete. The LRT will connect Conestoga Mall in Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in Kitchener via a 19 KM line. In the end, their will be 36 kilometres of rail line with 22 stops connecting the three major centres of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo.

We have a video of the adjacent city of Waterloo, ending pretty much where this video starts. Check it out here: https://youtu.be/ES16oTTDCqk

Channel Name: Explore USA Cities
Description: Filmed on Monday, May 7 2024, I drive around downtown Detroit to see what's going on.

The city's name comes from the French word d√©troit meaning 'strait' as the city was situated on a narrow passage of water linking two lakes.

in 1701, Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit was founded by a group of 100 French settlers, which would become the future city of Detroit.

France offered free land to colonists to attract families to Detroit; when it reached a population of 800 in 1765, this was the largest European settlement between Montreal and New Orleans.

By 1773, after the addition of Anglo-American settlers, the population of Detroit was 1,400.

The region's economy was based on the lucrative fur trade, in which numerous Native American people had important roles as trappers and traders.

During the French and Indian War, British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760 and shortened its name to Detroit.

Following the American Revolutionary War and the establishment of the United States as an independent country, Britain ceded Detroit along with other territories in the area.

Prior to the American Civil War, the city's access to the Canada‚ÄìUS border made it a key stop for refugee slaves gaining freedom in the North along the Underground Railroad.

In 1903, Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. Ford's manufacturing‚Äîand those of automotive pioneers William C. Durant, the Dodge Brothers, Packard, and Walter Chrysler‚Äîestablished Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital.

 In 1920, the city's population was fourth largest in the nation.

Business in Detroit boomed along with its growing automobile industry, leading to an increase in downtown's population and wealth. Much of the downtown area's architecture was built during this boom, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and still attracts the attention of architects.  

Jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in World War II that 400,000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943.

Detroit hit it's peak population of 1.849 million in the 1950 census, which was about 1/3rd of the entire state's population.

Over the next sixty years, Detroit's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's population. 

During the same time period, the sprawling Detroit metropolitan area, which surrounds and includes the city, grew to contain more than half of Michigan's population.

The 1970s saw a decline of the US auto industry.  Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign car makers as the price of gas rose.  Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city.

High unemployment was compounded by middle-class flight to the suburbs. The result for Detroit was a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, and high crime rates. 

However, in recent years, the downtown area has seen tremendous growth and redevelopment.

Throughout the late 2010s, a large amount of business and investment have continued to enter the city and transform it. As of 2019, businesses such as Shinola, Google, Moosejaw, and Nike occupy the once-vacant street fronts. Investments such as new bike lanes, the Little Caesars Arena and QLine have been successful in attracting newcomers to the city.

The population of full time residents in downtown Detroit is relatively low.  As of the 2020 census, there were 6,151 people living downtown.

Today, downtown Detroit hosts around 80,000 workers which make up about one-fifth of the city's total employment base.

While Detroit has one of the highest violent crime rates in the nation, the downtown area has lower crime than national and state averages.

Because of its unique culture, distinctive architecture, and revitalization and urban renewal efforts in the 21st century, Detroit has enjoyed increased prominence as a tourist destination in recent years. The New York Times listed Detroit as the ninth-best destination in its list of 52 Places to Go.

Time Magazine named Detroit as one of the fifty World's Greatest Places of 2022 to explore.

Description: Downtown St. Louis is the central business district of St. Louis, Missouri, the hub of tourism, sports, entertainment, and the anchor of the St. Louis metropolitan area. Its iconic, 630-ft. Gateway Arch, aka "Gateway to the West", built in the 1960s, honors the early 19th-century explorations of Lewis and Clark and America's westward expansion in general. With its incredible architecture and engineering marvel, the Gateway Arch has been a popular tourist attraction of St Louis.

Lyrics 

perfect, easy, so good to me
so why's there a pit in my gut in the shape of you?
distract myself, say it's somethin' else
maybe i'm just overwhelmed, maybe i'm confused

barely sleep when you sleep next to me
but i keep thinkin' i'll find a cure
i say that i'm fine, i tell you all the time
i've never felt so happy and sure

but i'm so scared of my guitar
'cause it cuts right through to the heart
yeah, it knows me too well so i got no excuse
i can't lie to it the same way that i lie to you
i'm so scared of my guitar
if i play it, then i'll think too hard
once you let the thought in, then it's already done
so i‚Äôll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

if i was brave and noble like you
i'd have the nerve to just stop stringin' you along
but i'm not half as decent as you
i'd rather be tied to someone, even if they're wrong

i make excuses, my friends know the truth is
i'm not as alright as i claim
i say that i'm fine, i tell them all the time
as they watch all the light fade away

yeah, i'm so scared of my guitar
'cause it cuts right through to the heart
yeah, it knows me too well so i got no excuse
i can't lie to it the same way that i lie to you
i'm so scared of my guitar
if i play it, then i'll think too hard
once you let the thought in, then it's already done
so i‚Äôll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
yeah, i‚Äôll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

i pretend that it's love
i pretend that it's love
i pretend that it's love, love

'cause what if i never find anything better?
the doubt always creeps through my mind
so we'll stay together 'cause how could i ever
trade somethin' that's good for what's right?

oh, i'm so scared of my guitar
it cuts right through to my heart
it knows me too well, i got no excuse
i can't lie to it the same way that i lie to you

i'm so scared of my guitar
when i play it that‚Äôs when i think too hard
i let the thought in, it's already done
but i‚Äôll lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
yeah, i‚Äôll lay in your arms and pretend it's enough

This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it the "opportunity of a lifetime."

With a new EP and a year of big moves on tap, Warner Music Nashville‚Äôs Chase Matthew continues to make his case as one of Country‚Äôs boldest new voices. A Music City native, the rising star began his career by blazing an independent trail, leveraging an infectious country-or-nothing personality, rowdy live performances, and authentic music built around his low-slung vocal twang. Amassing nearly 900M global career streams (with more than 150M global streams on his first RIAA PLATINUM-certified smash, ‚ÄúCounty Line‚Äù), Matthew has garnered 1.5M+ followers across social media; named ‚ÄúOne to Watch‚Äù by HITS; and among MusicRow‚Äôs Next Big Thing Class of 2024. Since releasing his sophomore album, Come Get Your Memory, he spent 2023 selling out venues across the nation on his headline COME GET YOUR MEMORY TOUR, while also performing at major festivals and more. His debut single ‚ÄúLove You Again‚Äù is nearing Top 30 at Country radio, and along with releasing his six-song EP We All Grow Up ‚Äì a mix of backroad swagger and broken hearts ‚Äì he‚Äôs set to spend this year extending his wildly popular headline run, as well as joining Jason Aldean for the HIGHWAY DESPERADO TOUR.

Lyrics:
We had a plan 
Move out of this town baby 
West to the sand We had a
It‚Äôs all we talked about lately 
I‚Äôd pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smoking 
First thing at dawn you‚Äôd cue the songs and we‚Äôd get going

But you weren‚Äôt home 
Waited on the porch for ya 
Sat there alone
All throughout the morn till I
Got a hunch, down in my gut 
And snuck around the back 
Empty cans and I‚Äôll be damned 
Your shit was never packed 

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there‚Äôs a will then there‚Äôs a way and I‚Äôm damn sure you lost it 
Didn‚Äôt even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What‚Äôs your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be forgotten 
In 40 years you‚Äôll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin 

A hell of bluff
You had me believin‚Äô
How many months
Did you plan on leaving
What happened, bad habits 
Did you go back,
Go batshit 
I loved you, how tragic

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there‚Äôs a will then there‚Äôs a way and I‚Äôm damn sure you lost it 
Didn‚Äôt even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What‚Äôs your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll be forgotten 
In 40 years you‚Äôll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin

I‚Äôve heard your cries for a thirst tweets video, but always felt a little weird about reading those messages. So, I invited my sick and twisted friend, Pam, over to read them for me. Pam is a speaker, comedian, disability advocate, and certified sicko so she had no problem diving into these tweets and embracing the strangest ones. Surprise, even though there was a lot of silliness in here, we also found a way to discuss premature ventricular contractions, vitamin D supplements, serotonin, broken ribs, polydipsia, flu shots, prostate exams, and chest compressions. Thanks to Buzzfeed for this concept and all of you on Twitter who sent these in!

‚Ä¢ Lyrics:
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you'll see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

I'm more than just a picture
I'm a daughter and a sister
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a rumor
Or a song on your computer
There's more to me than people know

Somedays I'm broke, somedays I'm rich
Somedays I'm nice, somedays I can be a bitch
Somedays I'm strong, somedays I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you'll see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl

I'm more than just a number
I'm a hater, I'm a lover
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a title
Or a comment going viral
There's more to me than people know

Somedays I'm broke, somedays I'm rich
Somedays I'm nice, somedays I can be a bitch
Somedays I'm strong, somedays I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you'll see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl

I'm not just a pretty girl

Description: I want my money back Andrew...

Anyways I tried out Andrew Tate's Discord clone called "The Real World" to chat with special individuals, learn how to hustle "like a G", and most importantly, to escape slavery. All of these are things Discord doesn't offer if that wasn't clear.

But the real world offers special features that Discord can only dream of. You have power levels, power boosters, power ups, coins, courses, cults, clans, and enough nerdy references to make you think you are in a dungeons and dragon's server.

I dived into every nook and cranny this Discord clone had to offer. But the most beautiful thing of all, is the community. And my goodness...... these people are lost

Description: In this interview with Pierre Poilievre, the Leader of the Opposition, as he shares his vision for Canada and critiques the current government's policies. Filmed in Penticton BC, Poilievre addresses the concerns of South Okanagan residents who feel neglected by the NDP's coalition with Justin Trudeau's Liberals. This conversation delves into the pressing issues facing Canadians today, including skyrocketing housing costs, spiralling food prices, increasing homelessness, and the rampant rise in crime. 

Poilievre outlines his approach to solving these problems, emphasizing the need for lower prices, capped Government spending, and more effective law enforcement. He also discusses his plan to address climate change through technology rather than taxes, advocating for the expansion of green energy projects and faster permitting for green mines.

This video is a must-watch for anyone interested in the future direction of Canada offering insights into Poilievre plans to reduce government waste, incentivize green energy production, and restore Canada's prosperity.

Description: Brother Made My Life Hell, Then Got My Wife Pregnant. Now He... - Best Reddit

Brother Made My Life Hell, And Got My Wife Pregnant. Now He Wants My Help After Our Parents Disowned Him and Left Me Their $2 Million Inheritance.
-
The story begins with the narrator, an older brother, describing a life overshadowed by his younger brother, David, who was always the favored child in the family. Despite being the golden child, David harbored a deep-seated resentment toward the narrator, who was independent and introverted. Throughout their childhood, David bullied the narrator relentlessly, with their mother often dismissing the abuse as sibling bonding.

David‚Äôs bullying ranged from verbal insults to dangerous pranks, like nearly setting the narrator's hair on fire. The narrator's pleas for help were often ignored or downplayed by their mother, while their father was mostly absent due to work. The turning point came when the father finally recognized the severity of David's behavior and took steps to protect the narrator, even enrolling him in MMA classes to build his confidence and self-defense skills.

The narrator eventually left for university, escaping the toxic home environment and thriving academically and socially. He met Karen, whom he later married after discovering she was pregnant. Their relationship faced challenges, including Karen‚Äôs infidelity, but they tried to move forward for the sake of their son and their future together.

Years later, Karen confessed to an ongoing affair with David, shattering the narrator‚Äôs world. She revealed that their son might actually be David‚Äôs, which a paternity test later confirmed. This revelation led to the narrator leaving Karen and seeking support from his parents, who were initially shocked and then angry upon discovering the extent of David's betrayal.

The narrator‚Äôs father decided to cut David off financially and emotionally, disowning him and altering his will to leave everything to the narrator. David, now struggling without his parents' support, tried to reach out to the narrator for help. The narrator refused, reminding David of the consequences of his actions.

The narrator‚Äôs mother, still sympathetic towards David, leaked information about the will to him, causing family tensions. The narrator's father threatened to leave her if she continued to support David, forcing her to distance herself from her favored son.

Five months later, the narrator has a better relationship with his father, enjoying weekends together and receiving a promotion at work. He is in therapy, slowly healing from the trauma of his past. David, now living with Karen and their son, struggles to make ends meet after dropping out of college. The narrator chooses not to engage with David or Karen, focusing instead on his own recovery and future.

Description: Indian web design is cheap - low cost, yet high reward. With 1.44 billion people in India, website designs gotta work for people of different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities, yet stay financially affordable. When certain "cheap" designs prove to be effective and usable, does it matter if they still "look good"?

In this video, I cover the history, psychology, and culture of Indian web design. I discuss the rise of mobile experiences, why some websites never change, the impact of user demographics on design, India's price-sensitive economy, and how we can make products that work globally. If it get's the job done, maybe it's ok to lower costs‚Ä¶

Description: When Google first expanded Maps to India in 2008, there was a problem. Many streets did not have names. This was before phones had accurate GPS, so unless you had a compass telling you how far you've travelled, directions on Google Maps were pretty much useless.

UX researchers and designers knew that people used landmarks around the world - but how did India do it? India was huge untapped market for Maps, so Google better fix the problem - quick. Here‚Äôs how they did it with scrappy, but effective user research.

Description: I completely restarted my streaming journey from scratch at the start of 2023, I went from always having 150 average viewers, to zero viewers‚Ä¶  but then for my first stream on a new account, new platform, and entirely new audience‚Ä¶  I had 80 average viewers, I did this by following a simple, clear, actionable series of steps, literally, anyone can do. 

If you‚Äôre starting from 0, and you have no experience, it‚Äôs kind‚Äôve like going on a cross-country road trip, you don‚Äôt just get in the car and drive, you need to plan out where you‚Äôre going, what you‚Äôre excited to see, what music you‚Äôre listening too, and most importantly‚Ä¶ what snacks you want to bring.

If you didn‚Äôt do any of this, you‚Äôd end up bored, aimless, and starve to death‚Ä¶ coincidentally that is the 3 main things that happen to new streamers.

To avoid this, I created a plan, specifically a Content Map.

by that I mean, you need to understand who your audience is, what they love, and then you need to stream with the idea of making content for Tik tok, Yt shorts, instagram, full youtube videos, and any of the thousands of other platforms.

How To Grow On Twitch?

If you want to grow your Twitch stream, it is important to be critical. Being critical isn‚Äôt a bad thing, people say, ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt be so critical of yourself!‚Äù.

But there are a lot of things you can control and improve, such as your visuals, audio, and most importantly your content that you‚Äôre creating. Watch back your VoD and be honest with yourself, is it up to scratch. Does your mic sound good? Are you engaging? Is it easy to watch and enjoy or is there something that is off-putting? Be honest, push yourself to grow, and become a better entertainer!

Because at the end of the day, the only way you are going to grow your stream is by growing yourself and being critical in a positive way.

What Bitrate And Settings Should I Use For Streaming?

The easiest way to understand bitrate is by calling what it actually is, your upload speed to the Twitch servers.

Now you‚Äôll need a higher bitrate depending on how high quality you want your stream to be, this means 1080p 60 frames per second will need a bitrate of 6000, which roughly equals 6megabits upload speed on your end being taken up

By lowering your resolution and framerate, you can make it a lot easier to stream, for example, if you set your base canvas size to 1920x1080, but change your output to 1280x720 otherwise known as 720p you drop down to only needing a bitrate of 4500 or 4.5megabits.

If you still want 1080, you can even just lower your framerate from 60fps to 30fps and then adjust to 4500bitrate. 

For more information visit this Bitrate graph: https://stream.twitch.tv/

The style of this video is similar to Alpha Gaming and Gaming Careers in parts. A large influence on this series has come from content creators like Wild4games and Nutty.

Lyrics
I know you wanted me to stay 
But I can‚Äôt ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there‚Äôs a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day 

I‚Äôm having wicked dreams
Of leaving Tennessee 
Oh, Santa Monica 
I swear it‚Äôs calling me 

Won‚Äôt make my mama proud
It‚Äôs gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl 
I know she‚Äôs gonna scream

God, what have you done 
You‚Äôre a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I‚Äôm just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It‚Äôs where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony Club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club 

I‚Äôm up and jaws are on the floor 
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night‚Äôs another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams 
A year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
You‚Äôve been too good to be 

Won‚Äôt make my mama proud 
It‚Äôs gonna cause a scene 
She sees her baby girl 
I know she‚Äôs gonna scream 

God, what have you done 
You‚Äôre a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I‚Äôm just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It‚Äôs where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony club, Pink Pony club 

Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve left you all behind 
Still love you and Tennessee 
 you‚Äôre always on my mind 
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern draw a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done 
You‚Äôre a pink pony girl 
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I‚Äôm just having fun 
On the stage in my heels
It‚Äôs where I belong down at the 

Pink Pony Club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing down in 
West Hollywood 
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing at the 
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club 

I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing
I‚Äôm gonna keep on dancing

LYRICS
 
It‚Äôs fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing but you know the truth
And guess i'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You just wanna love someone who calls you baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

I‚Äôm cliche 
Who cares 
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And i cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin‚Äô  i just need a little air 

Think im gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

And when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands you‚Äôre nothing more than his wife 
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with ""i told you so""
You know I hate to say , i told you so
You know i hate to say it but, i told you so
Well i told you so 

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! Well good luck, babe!
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You‚Äôd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

Description: "Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people." - Proverbs 14:34

In this video, we dive deep into why so many Canadians seem disengaged with Canadian politics, even though our government impacts every aspect of our lives‚Äîfrom healthcare and education to housing and long-term care. As the US elections capture global attention, Canadian voter turnout continues to drop, particularly in Ontario, where record low engagement means that voices are being left unheard. Why does this happen, and how can we change it?

In this video, I break down the key differences between Canadian and American political structures, explain the voting process in Canada, and clarify what federal, provincial, and municipal governments are responsible for‚Äîsince so many Canadians place the blame on the wrong level of government. We‚Äôll also discuss Ontario‚Äôs current political landscape under Doug Ford‚Äôs Conservative government, highlighting some major criticisms, from withheld funding and mishandling of the pandemic to unaffordable housing and healthcare worker wage suppression.

Description: What Donald Trump‚Äôs win means for abortion, immigration, foreign policy, and more.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, will also be its 47th president. After voting him out of office in 2020, American voters changed their minds, opting for a return to his policies and his politics.

But the second Trump presidency will look very little like the first. His policies have evolved, his circumstances have changed, and he will be returning to office with a much more focused plan than the one he entered with eight years ago.

In this video, we ask six Vox reporters what we should expect from Trump‚Äôs second term, on topics from foreign policy to abortion.

00:00 Intro
1:16 Guardrails
3:10 Immigration
4:22 Immunity
5:40 Gaza
7:24 A quick message
8:19 Abortion
9:49 Tariffs
11:40 Government

Description: Anyway, Vote.org everybody. 

I am going to keep thinking about the "Everything is a Conspiracy Theory if you don't know how anything works" meme. I think it's, like, 50% right. But really important to note here that the fact that I got a ballot with democrats all on the bottom was both unlikely and guaranteed. Like, it was unlike that I would get one with all democrats on the bottom, but guaranteed that SOMEONE would. So conspiracy theories are really:

One part distrust in systems
One part not knowing how systems work
One part the universe presenting you with information that confirms your anti-system biases. 

And, of course, all three of those things lean on each other. Not understanding systems because they are massively complex leads to distrusting those systems. Not trusting systems leads to being more likely to falsely misattribute something random to something malicious. And then of course you have all of the magnification systems of the news media and social media and wall-to-wall bad actors who just want to win elections.

This year, more people will likely vote than ever before in history. It‚Äôs being called the ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Election Year‚Äù, when countries with half the world‚Äôs population can vote for their leaders. This big test of democracy requires millions of polling stations and billions of ballots.

But voting‚Äôs not always easy! People might deal with long lines or need to travel far distances. In the US, we vote on a Tuesday, so people often need to take time off work‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm really excited to vote! And I‚Äôve also been wondering‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt it be easier if I could just‚Ä¶ hit a button on my phone?

Why can‚Äôt I vote online? And what would happen if I could?

Over the past two months, I called up a bunch of voting and security experts to try to answer that question. And the answer I found is more controversial, complicated, and high stakes than I could have ever imagined‚Ä¶

Description: In 2016 I remember looking at buying an apartment for the first time in the city of oakville ontario. At this time I was working in toronto while also doing youtube on the side, and i thought that if I saved up for a few more months, i would go ahead and buy an apartment. 

Funny enough, I remember the exact apartment I wanted to buy. It was on lakeshore, it had lake views, it was a one bedroom and a den, new construction, and was being sold for around $330,000.

Now, I ended up not purchasing that apartment. But i just checked at how much this 1 bedroom apartment is selling for now, 8 years later.

Want to take a guess?

Well, under normal, but still good circumstances, the value of this apartment would increase 3% per year, which would make it worth around $418,000 today. 
However, today, this exact apartment is now selling for $730,000. For a 1 bedroom condo.
You would need $146,000 saved for the downpayment, and have a household income of over $150,000. That income  would put you in the top 10% of all household earners in canada.

So think about this. In 2016, a single male, fresh out of university, could theoretically afford this place making an above average income and some good savings.

Now, it requires you to either be a top 2% income earner on your own, or a top 10% household income, to afford this 1 bedroom condo.

So, i know you have probably heard about canada‚Äôs real estate issue before, and all around the world this is happening, its just the worst in canada, by quite a bit.

But this video isnt just about housing. Its about canada‚Äôs economy. Its horrific economy. And how pretty much within the span of a decade, Canada has gone from one of the most prosperous countries in the world, to one that officially as of today, has gone through a lost decade. 

Growing up in the great white north was great. The Canadian dream was alive and well, the economy was booming, it was one of the safest and happiest places on earth, 

Hey you wanted to be a canadian astronaut, boom, chris hadfield played guitar in space. Want to be a professional hockey player, but you were only 165 lbs and from rural ontario? Boom wayne gretzky. And most importantly for this video, if you wanted to start a business from pretty much nothing, it was very possible in canada. I mean we had blackberry which was bigger than apple for awhile, we had lululemon, opentext, heck‚Ä¶we even turn the ultimate canadian nemesis, the canadian goose, into one of the biggest clothing brands in the world. And if that doesnt signal perseverance of the canadian people, i dont know what does. 

However, over the last few decades, this spirit of entrepreneurship has faded dramatically.
In the year 2000, about 3 out of every 1,000 canadians were entrepreneurs. Today, despite all those people selling crystals with ‚Äòentrepreneur‚Äô in their bio, only 1.3 out of every 1,000 canadians are entrepreneurs according to BDC. thats a falloff of over 50% in 24 years. Infact, despite canada having 12,000,000 more people today than it did 24 years ago, there are actually 100,000 less entrepreneurs today than 24 years ago.

And is this a large reason why canada has been going through its worst decline in the post ww2 era? A lost decade.. Where real gdp per capita is in the exact same place where it was in 2015. Meaning that the average canadian is the same or worse off than they were 10 years ago.

There are so many stats that i can talk about that are at lows for he country. Gdp per capita has fallen, foreign investment has fallen off a cliff. birth rates are extremely low. Canada‚Äôs household debt to income ratio is 184%. One other interesting stat is that canada is the only country in the G7, that has a higher household debt than its total GDP.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65688460 
Think about that. Just household debt, not government debt, is higher in canada than GDP. 

And speaking of GDP, I think I have to briefly touch on a topic that i‚Äôve mentioned in many previous videos, but the small GDP growth of canada is an artificially inflated number. You see, before the pandemic, canada had a law where if unemployment was above 6%, canada would not accept any temporary foreign workers to fill low wage positions. The purpose of this law is to make sure that when unemployment is high, canadians could still find work. Its also to ensure that wage growth happens, and that the labor market isnt to tilted towards large corporations.

Ths time we look at the Rabbit R1  and discuss how these AI devices don't actually cure any problem, instead serve as a bedrock for a technology that could be very game changing in the future.

Description: Speaking during question period on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had a heated exchange about rising vehicle thefts in Canada.

‚ÄúAuto theft has run rampant under this prime minister. He's now throwing a cape over his back, claiming that he's the hero on auto theft. But it's actually tripled in Toronto and it's up by 100 per cent in Montreal after he brought in catch and release and house arrest for car thieves,‚Äù Poilievre claimed.

In response, Trudeau said that his government‚Äôs solution to auto theft is to "Roll up our sleeves, pull together partners from across the country and get to solving it.‚Äù He also said Poilievre‚Äôs solution is to ‚ÄúThrow his hands up in the air. Blame a raft of political attacks on us and continue to see that he's not putting forward any real solutions.‚Äù

During the heated exchange, Poilievre remarked ‚ÄúOh wow, is he ever losing control of himself? Oh, my goodness. Screaming and hollering like that.‚Äù

I Survived 100 Days in Hardcore Minecraft and here is what happened. Not Modded Minecraft. No Mods. Not Speedrunner Vs Hunter, More like Survivalist Vs Hunter but to the extreme. Skyblock, One Block, UHC/Ultrahardcore none of these. Just Hardcore Minecraft. Not 1.17 caves and cliffs update 1.16. Trios but duos.

Description: A lot of people looking into this field are worried that they might regret choosing to pursue this.  Here is my personal experience on why I do NOT regret being an Environmental Engineer.

1) Job market
Yes, the job perspective is small now but that just means there is room to grow in the future. We know that the environment is not in a sustainable trajectory, so we will be in high demand once people realize that the environment is important.

2) Pay
I get paid $82,500 USD a year. That is a good pay for my age, and I am happy with where I am at in life.

3) Humanitarianism and doing the right thing
We are preserving for the future no matter what people say. 

4) Not stressful
My work has a good balance between work and life. Yes, there will always be days where it is busy, but that comes with every job. I enjoy what I do and it is not as stressful as some other jobs out there.

I'm an Environmental Engineer currently working for the Air Force. I oversee their Hazardous Waste, Hazardous Materials, Integrated Solid Waste, and Qualified Recycling Programs. I have a Bachelors in Chemistry and a Masters in Environmental Engineering. My professional work experiences range from cancer R&D, teaching at a college level, and environmental compliance. 
On this channel, I'll be sharing my story on what it's like being an Environmental Engineer, detailing the good and bad of the position. Some other relatable topics may include personal growth, job hunting, and minimalism all through the perspective of a millennial.

I decided to give my girlfriend a break from difficult games since she's got a full schedule right now. Instead I "made her play" Beat Saber. She didn't need a lot of convincing for this one though haha. I made my girlfriend play Beat Saber turned out to be a huge hit, and I may never get to play with my headset again!

Would you like it if minecraft was free to play?

This is not when a fortnite player plays minecraft, if minecraft was controlled by parents, when you join your old mineraft world, if minecraft gave you life advice, I survived a week on one heart, why I removed the end, or any video like that. This is if minecraft was free to play.

Jesus said to love one another and that we should be servants to each other, so I would ask that you all do that in the comment section. Be respectful. We are a community. That means more to me than anything. Thank you.

Lyrics:

Time slows down when it can get no worse
I can feel it running out on me
I don‚Äôt want these to be my last words  
All forgotten ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs all they‚Äôll be

Now there‚Äôs only one thing I can do
Fight until the end like I promised to
Wishing there was something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you

What do you see before it‚Äôs over?
Blinding flashes getting closer
Wish that I had something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you
This could be the day I die for you

This could be the day I die for you
This could be the day   

Everything I know
Everything I hold tight
When to let it go
When to make em all fight
When I‚Äôm in control
When I‚Äôm out of my mind
When I gotta live 
When I gotta die gotta die

Everything I know
Everything I hold tight
When to let it go
When to make em all fight
When I‚Äôm in control
When I‚Äôm out of my mind
When I gotta live 
When I gotta die 

Feeling like there‚Äôs nothing I can do
This could be the end it‚Äôs mine to choose
It‚Äôs taken me my lifetime just to prove
This could be the day I die for your
Don‚Äôt let it be the day‚Ä¶.

What do you see before it‚Äôs over?
Blinding flashes getting closer
Sacrificing everything I knew
This could be the day I die for you

Cat is a solitary animal, but as his home is devastated by a great flood, he finds refuge on a boat populated by various species, and will have to team up with them despite their differences. In the lonesome boat sailing through mystical overflowed landscapes, they navigate the challenges and dangers of adapting to this new world.

Description: Is Pierre Poilievre The Canadian Equivalent Of Donald Trump?

He's been in first place in the polls for months and all indications are, he could be Canada's next prime minister. But how much do we really know about Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre? And are the comparisons to Donald Trump valid? That's a question broadcaster Andrew Lawton attempts to answer in his new book "Pierre Poilievre: A Political Life."

Lyrics:
Aquamarine
Honey dive into me
I‚Äôm not hiding, anymore 
I won‚Äôt hide 
 
The world is my oyster 
Baby come touch the pearl 
The world is my oyster 
And I‚Äôm the only girl 
 
I‚Äôm dancing in my own reflection 
I‚Äôm the ray of light
I‚Äôm transforming and realigning 
I‚Äôll take you with me h-h-h-h-high 
 
Aquamarine
Honey dive into me 
I‚Äôm not hiding, anymore
I won‚Äôt hide
I‚Äôm free 
 
Swimming in the sea with the salt in my hair 
Kissed by the sun it‚Äôs a love affair
Heart of the ocean around my neck
Don‚Äôt have to say it 
You know what‚Äôs next 
 
I‚Äôm transforming and realigning 
I‚Äôll take you with me h-h-h-high 
 
Give me more 
Give me more 
Give me more 
Give me more
Give me 
 
Aquamarine
Honey dive into me 
I‚Äôm not hiding, anymore 
I won‚Äôt hide 
 
Aquamarine
Honey dive into me 
I‚Äôm not hiding, anymore
I won‚Äôt hide
I‚Äôm free

Lyrics:
hey Siri
Could you teach me how to cook an apple pie
say thanks in japanese
make a paper plane that flies

Hey Siri
could you cancel my alarm at 8:05
cause lately i can‚Äôt sleep
i‚Äôve been spending all my time

Just trying to find
All of the answers to the questions that you
Can‚Äôt look up online
Cuz I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that we‚Äôre only born to die
Hey Siri what‚Äôs the meaning of life?

Hey Siri,¬†
Could you tell me how to fix my broken heart
No one made it stop
I just can‚Äôt get it to start

hey siri
Are you happy, do you wish that you could cry
Are you as lost as me¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
Are you spending all your time

Just trying to find
All of the answers to the questions that you
Can‚Äôt look up online
Cuz I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that we‚Äôre only born to die
Hey Siri what‚Äôs the meaning of life?

Description: #DiscordMovie - only in theaters 2025.

Beluflix Studios presents "Discord: The Last Female," a thrilling adventure into the terrifying world of Discord. Directed by William Shakespeare, the film stars Jordan Peterson as Quandalius Dinglebottom, a determined Discordian on a quest to find the last remaining female in the Genshin Impact Discord server. As one can imagine, this is nearly an impossible task.

As Quandalius delves deeper into the land of Discord, he faces a series of challenges that test his resolve and question the nature of reality and what it means to be a woman. The film explores themes of identity, isolation, and the pursuit of a genuine female interaction amidst a sea of men.

With gripping storytelling and cutting-edge visuals, "Discord: The Last Female" is a timely reflection on modern communication and the lengths one will go to find authenticity in a virtual world.

The creative team includes cinematographer Napoleon Bonaparte, a dynamic score by Henry VIII and Leonardo da Vinci, and production design by Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

This time we take a look at what appears to be a Kick streamer once again breaking the law (shocking I know) and involving a homeless person only to leave them in a worse shape then they already are in. Truly wild stuff that could have actually been an amazing wholesome clip only to be turned into another example of bad streamer behaviour. Thanks for watching!

Description: Discord's legal team is currently disputing a DMCA subpoena from Nexon, the company behind the game Maplestory. But despite how uninteresting and unimportant this Discord news sounds, this legal battle sets the precedent of user privacy on online platforms.

However that's not the only reason why I wanted to talk about Discord's legal battle. This battle is filled with Discord's lawyers beefing with Nexon, incompetently filled legal documents, and much much more :)

Description: In this interview from Al Jazeera on October 16th, 2024; I discuss the current state of global privacy legislation, ways that we can encourage free speech without censorship, and strategies for the future of privacy around the world.

00:00 We Are Getting to a Real Scary Place
00:30 Criminalizing Privacy
03:17 Striking a Balance
05:54 The Future of Privacy is Up the Users

In an era where the web has converged on just a handful major companies that wield immense control over speech, we are seeing many independent voices drowned out. Instead of suppressing ideas, we can actually call out bad ideas for what they are and we can provide counterpoints. The best way to conquer bad ideas is with better ideas, not by suppressing ideas.

Xbox Ban Tool of 2023. How easy it was Microsoft to deny the rumors and the existence of the Xbox Ban Exploit, meanwhile this Xbox Ban Tool exists and can be used by anyone. In July of 2023, the GTA community warned the Xbox community about the Xbox Ban Exploit. This was a party pool used by Xbox Hackers on GTA that gave them to power to permaban anyone. At first, it's been rumored that this only affects someone if they accept a random party invite. It turns out it can affects anyone the Xbox Hacker chooses, as they can simply look up the target's gamertag. Turns out, that was fake.

But this Xbox Ban Tool is not fake. It's a legitimate service that is being sold to random people. Unlike the Xbox Ban Exploit, it isn't only exclusive to the GTA Online community on Xbox. As long as you pay for it, it's exclusive to anyone.  It works by utilizing bots to do whatever you want them to do. These Xbox bots can follow you, message you, REPORT you, ban you, blacklist you, whitelist you, etc. The person who created these Xbox Bots originally planned on selling bot followers on Xbox. He soon used his talents when he discovered how to spam report someone on Xbox. He can have over five thousand bots report you on Xbox. This doesn't guarantee and Xbox Ban. BUT it does guarantee immediate attention from Xbox Enforcement.

Bans can vary from person to person. This Xbox Ban Tool doesn't guarantee immediate Xbox Enforcement action or Xbox Bans. The original Xbox Ban Exploit did, but like Microsoft, I also think it was not real. I could've been easily banned with the Xbox Ban Bot Tool, but I wasn't. Luckily, my gamertag was blacklisted so it apparently guarantees me from not being banned. However, this doesn't apply to everyone that is innocent. So if you had any Xbox Enforcement Action, even as little as an Xbox Gamerpic Ban, you could easily fall victim to the Xbox Ban Tool. If you're 100% clean, you're very unlikely of being banned by the Xbox Ban Tool.

Today I am going to show you why Windows security questions aren't a particularly great idea to use if you want to keep your data actually secure... Microsoft storing answers in plaintext in a mass production operating system is something beyond me, but we shouldn't really be surprised anymore, should we? I forgot to add the disclaimer, by the way...

Description: The Internet Archive Hack gets weirder and weirder by the day.  After 22 days, hackers still have access to sensitive internal systems.  Archive.org has been offline for 11 days (and counting), and Internet Archive refused to respond to notifications of being hacked.  All immediately following Internet Archive's massive court loss which could destroy them as an organization.  And that's just for starters.

Something smells very, very wrong.  Did the Internet Archive allow themselves to be hacked?  Or... did they actually hack themselves?  That's crazy... right?  It's not as crazy as it might seem.

Let's go through the timeline of events and look at everything logically.

Karaoke is fun. For some people. But I don't want to cram myself into a tiny room where everything is too loud. But sometimes, you gotta do what makes people happy. So we started on a search to find the best at home karaoke solutions, and we think we found some decent options. But the search wasn't easy.

Description: Noobcrew/Mineverse thread:
https://skyblock.net/threads/skyblock-and-the-minecraft-marketplace-a-legal-battle.145369/

As someone not privy to the legal dispute, it's difficult to righteously take a side here.
It's easy to fall for the trap of going all guns blazing and supporting the smaller man - Noobcrew/Mineverse (N). I'd even say that it's the "kinder" thing to do. Microsoft and others (M) have vastly more resources capable of decimating every legal angle.
There are ramifications for both sides.
1. If N wins and "Skyblock" is trademarked, N has power to claim all media listed under registration of title "Skyblock". To give several examples per application: "content¬†creation¬†for¬†virtual¬†worlds¬†and¬†three¬†dimensional¬†platforms", "virtual environments", "hosting of digial content". N argues they have no intention of doing so, but this is not evidence of future intent. What is likely to happen in the short term is that all commercialised "Skyblock" maps/games/etc. will have to change their titles. I am unsure of other remedies N seeks to claim.
2. If M wins and "Skyblock" is not trademarked, "Skyblock" remains in public domain. M's content can be commercialised per status quo. Everyone is free to use "Skyblock" as they see fit. N probably has no other IP claims. N has no moral rights (i.e., crediting) either, although enforceability of moral rights is dubious anyway.
All laws are broken and unfair systems, but IP law is especially unrepresentative of individual (creative) interests. It doesn't work well. N is likely going to lose, and lose severely.
The worst of it is M is unwilling to settle. There are solutions, and no one is budging. Things do not have to be as bad as they are, but so long as M believes the law to be on their side, they will come out ahead.

Someone tried to SWAT me?! I'm really confused and this most likely was a coincidence? But I was suspecting something when the police showed up to my old address. On Saturday night, the cops were called to my old address. I was told about this the next day in the morning. And the cops were vague about the situation. They weren't acting as if some major threat was called so perhaps the swatter was tippy toeing and testing out the phony 911 call? OR this was a coincidence? I kinda think this was a coincidence but also kinda think it was intentional.

A similar situation happened before. The cops randomly showed up at the front door, and were asking if everything was ok and were responding to a call. But they never said what it was about. 2 years later and it happens again but it brings paranoia. On Xbox, I get hate messages sometimes. And among those hate messages and DDoS threats, it's usually a threat where a SWAT team is called. I don't usually pay attention to threats like that and look at it as empty threats, considering I'm more private and I have a VPN. And I only received around swatting threats over Xbox in the past 1-2 years so I rarely get threatened by some hater.

But after seeing the cops at my old address and realizing this happened before and remembering those Xbox swatting threats. It really makes me wonder. I did call the police's non emergency line and asked where the call came from and what the call was about. I don't think the call was serious since the police didn't bust down any doors. But long story short, the cops said they'll talk to the responding officers and see what they can find out and that they'll call me back. And... they NEVER called me back. I kinda figured they wouldn't. After you get swatted, the cops don't really care who placed the call. They usually run their own investigation and are embarrassed that they responded to a call that was placed across state lines.

If you sort MrBeast's video comments by "new," you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Anyway, enough yap city nation device...

My loneliness is killing me
I must confess, I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign

Description: On Thursday, Russell RCMP announced a 52-year-old man from Portage la Prairie was charged after organizing and leading a hunt for the animals inside another man's property, advertising it on social media.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/illegal-bison-hunting-charge-1.7355037

A 52-year-old Portage la Prairie man has been charged with mischief and theft after police say he organized and led an illegal bison hunt on another person's farm, which he advertised on social media.

On Monday afternoon, Russell RCMP received a report that six bison had been shot and taken from a farm in the rural municipality of Russell-Binscarth, about 300 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, near the Saskatchewan border.

Police were told by the farmer that he noticed the locks to the gates of his pasture were removed and replaced with locks that didn't belong to him, and he later discovered six of his bison were missing, Manitoba RCMP said in a Thursday news release.

Footage from trail cameras in the area showed four people, with a pickup and off-road vehicles, drove onto the farm property, shot the bison and took them from the farm, according to RCMP.

The next day, the farmer told police he had discovered a social media ad promoting a bison hunt on his property, for a fee of $1,000 per bison. The ad was not placed by victims, who were the legal owners of the bison, police say.

One of the victims told police they had posted to social media regarding the missing bison and received several responses, including from some of those who said they had shot the bison, RCMP said.

As someone who came from a Police family, I've certainly seen how a career in Policing can change a person.

I'm sure if we kept talking we would have given examples, including our many mistakes but perhaps thats another video.

Good luck to future applicants!

Description: I talk about being able to be ok with letting go of responsibilities of certain parts of yourself and not overthinking every single thing you can do, because sometimes there is nothing you can do. This is specific to your mood and mental state however.

This commentary video is a part of a series where I upload one Minecraft commentary video daily on a random commentary-related topic (sorry for saying commentary so much), while I play on a Minecraft SMP or Minecraft Skywars or Minecraft Parkour or Minecraft Bedwars or MCC Island or do random Minecraft stuff in the background. I really hope that this content can serve as both a motivator for myself, but also as a way for more people to discover my channel.

Just kidding. Discord's server discovery feature is plagued with two major issues that allow down-bad freaky servers to show up. Whether it be using the world's most advanced Discord exploit or just letting Discord do a horrible job at moderating, you will stumble across one of these servers.

But when you take a step back and observe some concerning Discord trends, you'll realize things are just going to get worse...

Fooling Minecraft Servers with a Fake Dream. An actual Minecraft Server. Not an SMP like the Lifesteal SMP or Dream SMP. I wasn't tricking Parrot / Rekrap / Tommyinnit / Technoblade or any youtuber. This was a Minecraft PVP server where I got to fight Dream and wanted to steal his popularity.

If you're reading this, I hope you have a great day! Told myself I wouldnt watch Dream's new vid until I uploaded. Finally I can go watch lol. I might make a Survival Hardcore video next because I've actually never beat Minecraft Hardcore before

üññ Hey! I'm Enrico and on this channel I go behind the scenes of the design, psychology and stories behind tech and making stuff on the internet. I'm a tech Product Manager,  builder of things made of pixels.


Behind the simple things you do everyday and take for granted, there is a hidden world of design, engineering, psychology, copying nature and tricks that make technology usable by humans. And most people never really notice it. There is so much that I left off this video (originally it would have been 40 minutes long): if you like these topics do let me know in the comments and I will bring you more of them!

Description: hi guys second channel video upload !!


@boomiee is my main (lack of upload omg)

Like Lomedy and his Infuse SMP Series, he was betrayed on this Minecraft SMP. Like Parrot / ParrotX2 Lifesteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 12.240 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. I escaped this Minecraft prison like Omziiscool but not Parrot or Clownpierce or Spoke with 100+ / 2,193 Bedrock and TNT.  This stacked player stole my permanent hearts on the Lifesteal SMP. Like any other video mine such as I Started Minecraft's Greatest Business, or I Trained a Minecraft Frog to Kill People, are unscripted videos of mines! in this video i will be trying to upgrade Minecraft's Oldest Traps/ Old Traps such as Tree Traps, Door Traps, Chest trap, ALL 3 BEING 8 YEARS OLD IN MINECRAFT/Xbox 360 Minecraft trolling.

Description: ‚û§Checkout GameMaker üëâ https://opr.as/GM-Zyger4

I Made a Physics Engine in Scratch. Scratch is a 2D platform intended for kids to make games. But today I decided to try and stretch the limits of the game engine and create an actual physics engine inside of it. This meant I had to figure out how to add my own rigidbodies, collisions, acceleration, friction thrust and more. But here's the catch... I only gave myself 1 hour !

‚û§Ignore:
In this video, I take on the challenge of building a fully custom physics engine inside Scratch‚Äîwithout using any pre-made assets or cheats! I started from scratch (pun intended) and developed my own acceleration and friction system for a cube. This meant that the cube could speed up and friction would slow it down.

But I didn‚Äôt stop there! I implemented actual collisions in scratch. Which maybe doesn't sound impressive but I never used to think this was possible. I added 2 different collision resolutions. One where the object simply stops and cant go through a wall. And another one where the cube bounces back.

One of the coolest features I added was an infinitely bouncing cube inside of an enclosed level. Doesn't sound to impressive but honestly it just looks really cool and is satisfying. 

If you're interested in how I built all of this within Scratch or want to learn more about creating custom physics engines, this video is for you! Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more creative coding content.

Well Discord is doubling-down on their Quests feature by expanding its capabilities into "Video Quests". Now the internet has stained us Discord mods to assume the worst, but this feature aint as bad as you think.

Also, Discord has been releasing some experiments regarding blocking, a League of Legends leaderboard (uh oh toxicity incoming), and reaction notifications so you know when someone doesn't want to respond to you but also doesn't want to ghost you.

Description: The Xbox LIVE Enforcement Team has the ability and authority to lift bans. If you believe your ban was wrongful (like mine), call the managers at the Xbox LIVE Enforcement Team!
3 Managers of Xbox LIVE Enforcement:
1. Borris
2. Andreas
3. Jason
And if you can't get through to them, feel free to send an email to Major Nelson (Larry Hryb). He is the director wizard guy of Xbox LIVE Content including oversight of Xbox LIVE Enforcement. As of January 2022, Xbox LIVE Enforcement has been going through changes which includes making changes to the Xbox LIVE Community Standards/Code of Conduct. These numbers may change, so first come, first serve. Their enforcement page is very slow and glitchy, it even doesn't show accurate bans that your Xbox account had suffered. I'm thinking these changes are being currently being made (as of January 15th, 2022).
It is VERY frustrating to be banned on Xbox LIVE so it only fair to show Xbox LIVE Enforcement's phone number so they can answer to these false bans.

What Are Transfer Packets & Will They Replace Minecraft Proxy Servers? This is a NEW Minecraft 1.21.1 video. In this video, I am going to talk about a brand new feature that Mojang recently added to Minecraft Servers. This feature is called Transfer Packets and it allows you to transfer players from one Minecraft Server to another. With just a single simple command, you can send any amount of players from one server to another one. Something which is usually only possible by using an additional proxy server server BungeeCord OR Waterfall OR Velocity. Could these Transfer Packets potentially completely replace proxy servers? Let's find out. It's very epic, fun, amazing and poggers! This will make playing Minecraft insane and amazing! Your players will absolutely love it! I had lots of laughs and fun. Hopefully, you'll get some useful information from this video. I love Minecraft fun!

Description: Using a Chromebook as my primary device for coding wasn't something I thought possible until I tried it. While the baseline chrome book is able to only run Chrome Based Applications, you can unlock a Developer Mode with a Linux Console Shell that let's you install everything from vscode to git and much more.

Since I have a computer, laptop and tablet for website development, I found coding and swapping devices sort of difficult especially with the fact that most environments require me to sync github in order to get back to coding my so important HTML, CSS and JS.

I have the chromebook a proper test over 7 days to test out different methods for programming, as people might be using it for many different applications. I would recommend this device for people looking to learn programming via freeCodeCamp or working on applications such as on React, Angular, Vue, etc.

If you're looking to do mobile application development such as on react native or flutter, this might not be the device for you

I used the program "VoiceAttack" so that whenever I say a mob's name in Minecraft, it will spawn 10 of that mob. I also added commands where if I say a color in Minecraft I teleport to it. so if I say "red" I will teleport to the color red. Also I did this while Twitch Chat controlled my Minecraft. This time if I say a Minecraft biome I teleport to it. This was inspired by DougDoug's Skyrim, but if I say "dragon" then 10 dragons spawn video but in Minecraft instead but mobs spawn if I say their name.

Description: ‚ö° Pssst! I have better alternatives to DDG and Brave VPNs: ‚ö°
‚úÖ  Try NordVPN - much faster, more locations - 79% off ‚û°Ô∏è https://ctzone.link/nordvpndeal_94/
‚úÖ  Surfshark - cheaper, unlimited connections - 88% off ‚û°Ô∏è https://ctzone.link/surfsharkdeal_94/

Let‚Äôs talk about actually private browsers ‚Äì Brave vs DuckDuckGo! Which one is better? Faster? Stronger? I‚Äôll cover their privacy pratices, search engines, UI and extra features, as well as overall usability. 

Also, keep your browsers ad-free and get an ad blocker!
‚úÖ  Total AdBlock - 80% off ‚û°Ô∏è https://ctzone.link/totaladblockdeal_94/

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

üë®üèªüíª DuckDuckGo vs Brave privacy comparison 

Is DuckDuckGo safe? The browser doesn‚Äôt use tracking cookies, doesn‚Äôt store user info or expose your searches to third parties. It even keeps the terms you searched hidden from the websites you click on. Plus, whenever possible, the DuckDuckGo browser automatically connects you to encrypted versions of websites.

 Is Brave browser safe? It updates connection to HTTPS whenever that‚Äôs possible, and blocks third-party cookies and trackers. It also doesn‚Äôt collect or share user data. Yet Brave browser takes things a step further. It blocks ads by default, doesn‚Äôt store browsing history and when syncing data across devices, it encrypts it, so nobody but you has access to it. Brave also has a private browsing mode that‚Äôs powered by Tor.

üê• Search engines

With the DuckDuckGo search engine ‚Äì you have no option to change it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs pretty good, but it‚Äôs nothing super impressive. It takes results from other search engines and anonymizes them. What about the Brave search engine? Once again, Brave is more customizable in this case. Brave Search has its own independent search index with more control over results and ranking. It allows you to choose HOW the results are ranked. Plus, you can also completely switch it. 

ü¶Å Extra features

Both browsers have a lot to show. DuckDuckGo has this very awesome ‚ÄúFire‚Äù button that completely closes all your tabs and data. Then you‚Äôve got the Bangs ‚Äì shortcuts to the most popular websites. I also wanted to mention the DuckDuckGo VPN. Brave Browser VPN is also a thing! But if you want a VPN, something like NordVPN or Surfshark will be a better choice ‚Äì and often cheaper too. 


‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

I do not own any of the content played in this video.

Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Tubbo / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.

Microsoft Banned my Xbox Console...AGAIN! So I‚Ä¶ just bought another one. Silly decision? Maybe. But I got videos to make. Buying a brand new one from a store is easy. It‚Äôs tricky getting a used one considering they are sold by third party vendors. Third party vendors are not always available. And I needed to buy a new Xbox Series X from a person ASAP. It‚Äôs also great knowing your money is not gonna directly contribute to Microsoft, considering they just issue device bans left and right. Getting a used Xbox Series X was a challenge. Especially when Microsoft bans your Xbox unexpectedly.

On Sunday, I got on my Xbox, and realized I received an Xbox Series X Console Ban which is the highest form of an insult by Microsoft or our good friends at Xbox Enforcement. Upon seeing this, I put all my videos to rest, and decided to just make a video about the Xbox Console Ban. I appealed this after so much digging through emails  but to no avail, they did not grant the appeal. At the same time, I went on OfferUp. Like the last Xbox Console Ban, I went on OfferUp to find a used Xbox Series X for sale. I found one for sale for $300 which was THE ONE. I needed THIS Xbox Series X before anyone else managed to snatch it up.

I made a quick video about my banned Xbox Series X, then through into my trash can. Next time, I started to chat with the seller who was selling a used Xbox Series X for $300. Shout out to Esme for the great deal! It definitely beats buying a brand new one from a store, giving Microsoft a cut of the money. We set up an exchange point, and I drove to pick up the Xbox. If you‚Äôre making videos, getting an Xbox as soon as possible is ideal. I was clearly in a hurry. I wanted an unbanned Xbox console that same day AND I wanted to be the first one to take up that deal. I guess the universe aligned everything and put me in this place to take this beautiful offer. An Xbox Series X for $300? Yes please! Take this L, Microsoft!

What is Minecraft Skyblock? What is the Minecraft Skyblock Server?
Minecraft Skyblock is a game mode based on Minecraft Skyblock servers where you progressively level up your island level. On java and bedrock edition In this series, I will show how to get rich fast, the best money methods, and the best starter strategies on Minecraft Skyblock servers. I will often show how to get money without rank as-well lucky skyblock style! Make sure to check out my EP 1 before starting the skyblock survival series. I am very excited about the series on this new Minecraft Skyblock server. Some skyblock servers even have PayPal payouts that they give to island top players! Definitely a top 5 Minecraft skyblock server. OPLegends runs Minecraft Skyblock server version 1.8.9 - 1.19.3 and Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Skyblock Xbox, PS4, PS5, mobile edition. That is all for my favorite Minecraft OP Skyblock server OPLegends! 

Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. 
This is an epic Minecraft Skyblock Server let's play!

My friends Wisp and Henwy decided it would be fun to challenge each other to a game of Minecraft death swap, where every 5 minutes we swap positions, and set traps for each other to kill them whilst remaining alive. Can I make it to the end and stay alive, or are they too smart for me? Leave your predictions below.

Description: Ever wondered how applications are able to communicate and coordinate with each other securely, while also extremely isolated from one another?

Inter-Process communication is one of the most critical parts of modern operating systems, yet nearly invisible to the user.

Join me as we pull back the curtain on this crucial yet often overlooked technology.  

We'll examine both the history and fundamentals of IPC systems, as well as focusing on one that runs on billions of devices worldwide, the Android Binder.  

Don't worry, there will be plenty of real-world code examples to follow along!

Description: North Korean Spies on Discord... this has to be a joke or some clickbait nonsense.

But from the bottom of my non-existent heart, I think there is a recruitment program ran by North Korea on Discord. Meant to trick unknowing Discord users into supporting North Korean IT workers (DPRK IT), to gain access to funds and potentially private corporate information.

The worst part about this whole investigation, is that I stumbled upon it by mistake. I was looking for Discord freelancing servers to make money on Discord. And between some obvious scams, I managed to find something that I didn't understand. And I unfortunately dug deeper than I maybe should have.

Today nuqi plays not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, Minecraft 100 Days, or any other Minecraft but challenge like that, but Minecraft short from nuqi! #shorts‚Äã #tiktok‚Äã #short‚Äã #Minecraft‚Äã

This Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / tiktok / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.16.5, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.18 in 2022 (almost 2023)!

The goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, nuqi from twitch / tiktok / twitter , playing Minecraft Java 1.18.2 and not Minecraft Bedrock.

Xbox Hacker OWNED by an RGH. I have mixed feelings about RGH consoles. Many people abuse them to ruin other games. No one likes that, except for the perpetrator(s). This was special because I found an Xbox Hacker on BO2 that pulled the victim card (which really annoyed me) and then his console got crashes by an RGH.

I was playing some BO2 and I ran into some Xbox Hackers. I eventually found one who spent an awfully suspicious amount of time in BO2 Theater Mode, and found he was modding an a public game with invisibility and god mode. Interestingly, he was split screening too and killing his split screening partner. So I'm not sure if his split screening buddy minded getting killed over and over again. Random players were, as usual, not having a good time and were leaving the game. So I decided to confront the Xbox Hacker to figure out why he wanted to cheat, despite the game being old.

The Xbox Hacker for the most part was quiet. He only talked a few times which involved the N word, pulling the victim card, saying I should get banned, etc. I was kicked out of his game many times which would result in me waiting 10 minutes for the game to end to join him. This took up a lot of time, as he enjoyed banning me from BO2 almost every game. But I was patient enough and kept joining his session in progress when I could. Other times, the game would freeze. Not sure why, but BO2 on Xbox had been having a lot of freezing problems lately.

Eventually, I joined his lobby where I warned everyone in the lobby that the Xbox Hacker was modding the game. A player who used an RGH heard everything, and crashed his console. He then modded his classes where it wouldn't let him load up public games. Considering the Xbox Live Enforcement Team doesn't actively care about the state of an old game, this was perhaps one of the best actions for an Xbox Hacker. If you ruin the game with mods and cheats, then you'll be banned from playing the game... Until another ,Xbox Hacker with an RGH unfreezes your classes or whatever. The RGH player was playing BO2 with an RGH to combat Xbox Hackers and BO2 infection users, etc. And I always had a lot of respect for the people who use it against the people who abuse it.

And that promotes and encourages a culture of originality and respect, for the hard work that goes into developing new ideas, ultimately benefiting everyone. This is especially true for sandbox games such as minecraft that are heavily influenced by its community and the love that they pour into the game.

Description: Japanese version of "This is America" by Childish Gambino.
"This is Japan - da!"  ( Da is used to affirm and empasize your sentence in Japanese)    ÔºàÂ≠óÂπï„ÅÇ„ÇäÔºâ Japan is known as a beautiful and peaceful country..but in the reality as any country, it has bright and dark sides.
Trolls without "faces" ( also "honne" & "tatemae"), youths indifferent to the reality, quiet pressures to Japanese women,  politicians hiding truths... I introduced both sides of Japan - its beauty and closed society.

Xbox Hacker gets Booted. Oh, but what a poor guy! We found an Xbox Hacker who claimed to not be the main character but then showed signs of self entitlement. He also said confronting him meant I was flirting with him. Looking at it now, I think he was just saying that because he didn't know how to respond and clearly was never in a situation like this after getting caught cheating on BO2.

I was enjoying some Black Ops 2 until I got into a lobby where it was originally on the map, Plaza, but was soon changed to NukeTown 2025 midgame. This was not a glitch. This was a mod exploit, where an Xbox Hacker can change the map midgame from the mod menu. This Xbox Hacker loved NukeTown 2025. I confronted him in the game and eventually joined his session in progress after he left. We talked and eventually, he played the victim. He attempted to get the attention away from him so I can go after someone who booted him offline and called him racial slurs. That person also used an RGH.

The problem was that the RGH Hacker knew who I was and was familiar with what I do with Xbox Hackers, especially on BO2. He uses his RGH to combat the BO2 Theater Infection modders. I ended talking to him and getting his side of the story. The Xbox Hacker was NOT DDoSed/Booted like he claimed. He was not called any racial slurs. He was only pretending to be a victim of Xbox Hackers, despite being an Xbox Hacker himself.

The Xbox RGH Hacker was a subscriber of mine, but I don't want it to sound too biased when I say he was innocent. His story made sense and he was honest about what happened. The Xbox Hacker was not a very good liar. Besides, the Xbox RGH Hacker used his RGH to clean up BO2 of its theater mode infection infestation.

Like ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Leowook, RoshamboGames, ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / hermitcraft season 9/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2 / season 4. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lapata SMP or DoubleLife with Grian and Nizgamer25. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft and Hypixel Skyblock because PVP is on and there is revenge, griefing, stealing, scamming, and war! Similar to Parrot / ParrotX2 / Matrix of Lapata / Leowook and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP / Dream Face Reveal / tommyinnit hardcore smp / school smp parrot where he Started a War or Ended a War / LifeSteal SMP series, joined, survived, and I took over the lethal SMP. This is a lifesteal SMP copy. in Minecraft / Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2

What happened to sacramentolove's sister? This has been a very commonly asked question for over a year after I posted a video of me accessing a 12 year old Xbox 360 account. For over a year now, many people have been asking me this only for me to say this was a story for another time. Interestingly, I didn't think so many people would wonder what happened when I uploaded the original video. I thought the biggest thing people would care about was the Xbox 360 nostalgia thing, the last met 12 years ago, last online 10 years ago, etc. This video will explain everything but not too much to give out personal details. Just an explanation on what happened and why it was such a conspiracy.

"What happened to sacramentolove's sister?"
-No answer was truly ever made but an investigation concluded that my little sister fell victim to possible human trafficking. This answer was observed because of the evidence that was found during the investigation.

"Why did you wait so long to explain all this?"
-Initially, I didn't think people would care about my personal life. I made the video and said "This Xbox 360 account belonged to my sister. She was killed on Thanksgiving of 2020, but I won't bore you with that. Here's what you came for. Xbox 360 nostalgia!" The video managed to get more views that I anticipated, which led to a lot of people asking what happened. I wasn't ready to explain anyway.

"Is there bodycam footage of the crime scene?"
-Yes, getting the bodycam footage wasn't easy either because police departments don't like sharing something that can be used against them. A lot of the parts of the bodycam footage was muted and/or turned off because the officer(s) turned off their cameras which was even more suspicious considering the scene was a homicide case, not a suicide as the cops said. They lied to my family on what happened and now, I don't like cops anymore. If they're not corrupt, they're just incompetent.

After explaining what happened in this video, I go through some hate comments I got that really got to me because once someone sees a million views, their minds get angry for some reason. When I posted the video of me accessing a 12 year old Xbox 360 account, the video attracted some people to just say very negative stuff. Most of them either saying the video was fake and/or I milked my sister's death for views. Unknown to these people, that I can't tell the future and had no idea the video would get picked up by the algorithm. I appreciate you thinking I'm a time traveler though!

Thank you all for your support and taking time out of your day to watch the video. I hope justice is served one day, so my family can get closure.

I then clicked on these phishing links to see what lies beyond as I HOPE most of you guys never click these. Phishing links can be very drawn out convincing some people that are not paying close attention to its authenticity to give out their personal information. These links can also potentially reveal location/isp/install malicious software in the background. Let me go ahead and click on these for you and hopefully teach you some things to look out for if you don't know already. I hope you enjoyed the video! Please drop a like and a comment, it would be greatly appreciated! :D

Like ParrotX2 and his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP Series where he Started a War or Ended a War. Not Leowook, RoshamboGames, ClownPierce and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / hermitcraft season 9/ LifeSteal SMP series/ Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2 / season 4. TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lapata SMP or DoubleLife with Grian and Nizgamer25. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft and Hypixel Skyblock because PVP is on and there is revenge, griefing, stealing, scamming, and war! Similar to Parrot / ParrotX2 / Matrix of Lapata / Leowook and his LifeSteal SMP Season 2 / his School's Minecraft Server / School SMP / Brothers SMP / Dream Face Reveal / tommyinnit hardcore smp / school smp parrot where he Started a War or Ended a War / LifeSteal SMP series, joined, survived, and I took over the lethal SMP. This is a lifesteal SMP copy. in Minecraft / Minecraft LifeSteal SMP season 2

Description: If you‚Äôve played every LEGO Marvel game, then you might have been confused with the way that they handle their voice acting. While LEGO Marvel‚Äôs Avengers takes most of its dialogue straight from the films, both LEGO Marvel Super Heroes games use original voice acting. But every actor from the first one was replaced in the sequel. So what happened?

0:00 Intro
0:19 Explanation
1:01 Current Situation
1:30 Potential Future Impact

Well, around a year before that game was released, SAG-AFTRA, the union representing actors in film, television and video games, announced that voice actors would be going on strike against several publishers, including Warner Bros. Games.

The union‚Äôs major grievances were improved safety on set, with the hiring of stunt coordinators during high intensity motion capture scenes, prevention of injury due to vocal stress, better transparency surrounding roles ahead of recording and the payment of residuals. The studios were not willing to accept those last two demands, thus leading to the strike.

As a lot of their voice actors were either part of SAG-AFTRA or simply supporting the strike, TT Games was forced to instead hire non-union actors if they didn‚Äôt want to delay the game‚Äôs release. In September of 2017, after nearly a year of striking, an agreement was reached by both parties and the strike was ended. Less than two months later, the game was released.

If this situation sounds familiar to you, that might be because you‚Äôve heard of voice actors going on strike in July of this year. Struck companies include, again, WB Games, but also Epic Games, Take 2 Productions and Formosa Interactive, the latter of which handled voice over work for Horizon Forbidden West and may be doing so again for LEGO Horizon Adventures.

This time, the major issue is, expectedly, generative AI. While the union has been able to obtain better wages and job safety, it‚Äôs trying to gain protection for actors and stunt performers against the use of artificial intelligence to replicate their voice or likeness without consent or compensation.

So will this strike affect upcoming LEGO games? Well, it depends entirely on how far into development they are. Actors already working on in-development or live service games can continue work, but only for sixty days and that‚Äôs coming up in a few weeks.

Past that, they‚Äôll be required to join the picket line and you can expect voice actors to be replaced as well as potential delays.

Description: FYI this is just a ‚Äúwhat if scenario‚Äù. A man named Adolf Hitler Uunona really did win a Namibian election in 2020. However everything after that is fictional as you can tell by the dates of the news articles being set in the future and it was purposefully meant to parallel the real events that led to the original Hitler‚Äôs rise to power. (Also im not sure if him and the orginal hitler are the same height that was just something I kept for congruency lol). I hope this guy really does do good in the future and maybe even make some major history in Namibia since man would it be beautifully ironic.

Also P.S. if you legit thought this was real and didn‚Äôt pay attention to the dates or just simply did a second google search then man you need to think for yourself more ü´§

Xbox Responds to my Xbox Console Ban! But it was no help. It was your average Xbox NPC response but this time, the Xbox Safety Team; whom I call Xbox's priests, have sent me a friendly email, explaining why I was Xbox Console Banned. Spoiler alert, it was no help or any true insight to an actual answer. Xbox Enforcement or the Xbox Safety Team never say why you were banned. Typical...

So a few days ago, I received the infamolus Xbox Console Ban, or Xbox Device Ban...whatever the nomenclature is but it happened to me. So as usual, I ranted about it. I then appealed it on the Xbox Enforcement history page. I knew my appeal wasn't gonna work. I knew Xbox Enforcement wouldn't admit to a mistake and lift an Xbox Console Ban. Why would they? But about an hour later, Xbox Enforcement's priests, the Xbox Safety Team, sent me a very non-informative email explaining why my appeal was denied and why I was banned. Apparently, after a second thorough investigation was conducted, they were convinced that the Xbox Console Ban was a fair punishment. Keep in mind, I did not have any strikes on the Xbox Enforcement Strike System thing.

They simply denied it and said the banned gamertag was harassing other players through written OR verbal communications. There 100% was no written communications and they know this. So how did they come to the conclusion with EVIDENCE that the gamertag engaged in VERBAL communications? Oh right, because Xbox watches my videos. Real slick...

Some people said that the Xbox Ban Exploit method or glitch was responsible for the Xbox Console Ban but I don't even believe in the Xbox Ban Exploit thingy. I don't think it's real. And Xbox Enforcement banning people for no apparent reason is already so common with many people. In other words, don't blame the Xbox Ban Exploit. It doesn't exist.

Xbox Swatter sends a SWAT Team from a false 911 call. As far as the call went, it was about illegal firearms being kept inside a residence. But I do not have the current information. On Twitter, I received a DM from someone who claimed they were SWATTED. They claimed the person who called the SWAT team was the same person that made a TikTok about his deceased father to taunt him. As far as I understand (from what I heard from the party chat), the Xbox SWAT was targeted at someone because they had a speech impediment.

After reviewing the evidence over Twitter, I still had blanks to fill in. I was able to learn a bit more after talking with a potential Xbox SWATTER. Do I believe he was solely responsible for making the fake 911 police call? No. I somewhat believe the person who was blamed as the Xbox SWATTER. But he did tell me he knows someone that does make false 911 calls to SWAT someone over Xbox. Maybe that person was the one responsible? Maybe not, because the call was placed in Colorado. The Xbox SWATTER is located in Arizona. He might've gotten away with it with a VPN because the cops simply do not care. Cops never care what happens online, especially on Xbox.

From all the information I have, we know:
The aggressors told the victim to not sleep that night.
A SWAT team was dispatched to his apartment that same night.
The false 911 call came from Colorado, US.
The accused Xbox SWATTER does reside in Colorado.
The victim's address and IP address was leaked by the alleged Xbox SWATTER.
All of these things definitely make the alleged Xbox SWATTER look suspicious. But it doesn't necessarily say he did it. Besides, he told me he didn't do it and I was pretty convinced. But he did know someone who does, so my suspicions started up again.

SWATTING often refers to an individual calling the victim's local police department, and making obscene claims that would trigger an urgent response by the police, and dispatch a SWAT team to the residence. Often times, it's fake. But the police are NPCs that do not care once they realize it was false, unless someone loses their life. It can be a very traumatic experience to the victim. Depending on the circumstances, the SWATTER usually gets away with it as the police do not care and don't investigate something that made them look incompetent. This happened many times over Xbox and Playstation. Especially to people who would stream. Their address would be doxed and this would always get seen by a SWATTER.

Xbox Hacker but he's a Twitch Streamer. It's not new to catch a gamer cheating during a Twitch livestream. Ever since Warzone came out, the population of cheaters and hackers tripled, just so they can get a cheap win in front of viewers who send them donations. But on Black Ops 2 on Xbox? Yes, it's an old game. But other players shouldn't have to have their fun ruined because you felt like cheating due to skill issue.

I was playing some Black Ops 2 on Xbox and once I joined a lobby, the host of the lobby was boasting about being a host and how it's gonna be good for his Twitch stream. That's not really out of the ordinary but it was sketchy hearing him emphasize on being the host of the game. I looked over his player channel on BO2 and of course, he had a bunch of theater mode infection clips saved for easy access. But it's not really evidence. Sure, he may be using the theater clips to mod but there was no evidence to prove it. So I stayed in the game since I had nothing better to do and I thought I might as well enjoy the game if he isn't modding.

Some sketchy things happened such as all my teammates dying for no reason. But the game didn't show who did it. So I carried on with my eyes peeled. Eventually, the Xbox Hacker calls in a Lightning Strike in the game with only 150 points. A Lightning Strike is a score streak in Black Ops 2 that requires 750 points without dying. The Xbox Hacker only had 150 points with a score of 1 kill and 7 deaths. I checked the footage to see if he grabbed it from a care package but he didn't. So that alone was enough to confront the Xbox Hacker. The confrontation payed off, as he used his JIGY mod menu to kick me off the game, freeze me, etc.

I kept on returning to the game, just trying to get a better understanding but the Xbox Hacker was very upset, so he quit the game and went offline. Though I didn't get much of an explanation, the confrontation did make him stop playing the game and get off his Xbox. So at the end of the day, that was one less Xbox Hacker on BO2.

Xbox Pred tries seducing a 16 year old. He was caught and apparently, got very scared. We found out what he was doing and I instantly started investigating everything. We ended up confronting him and he apologized. He got scared but the apology was rather half-hearted. It was best to assume he was sorry he got caught. I caught Xbox Preds in the past that gave better apologies than this.

I received a DM from a subscriber, Allie, who is a 16 year old girl that was harassed by an Xbox Pedo. He tried seducing her even after she kept rejecting him and said she was uncomfortable. The Xbox Pedo was 22 years old. Allie even went on to say his advances were very wrong and that she was only in high school. She also told him she has a boyfriend anyway. She only liked the Xbox Pedo as a friend. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a 22 year old being friends with a 16 year old on Xbox. But it becomes very wrong once the older player tries seducing them and asks them on dates. Allie sent me the chats she had with the Xbox Pred and later claimed her friend was also harassed by him. The evidence really helped the case get investigated rather quickly because all that was left to do was confront the Xbox Pedo.

I tried getting the Xbox Pedo‚Äôs attention by using my infamous Ghost Hook law method. I attempted to get his attention by claiming he‚Äôs on the internet. This was meant to keep him engaged in a conversation. But like every other Xbox Pred, he ignored the message. So I had to go to plan B. The plan was to pose as a girl to get his attention. It worked and I got his attention. But he got spooked and stopped responding to my messages. So I made a last minute plan since this took me days and multiple attempts to catch the Xbox Pedo. I got a decoy. The decoy was a girl who was over 18, but could sound much younger.

The decoy sent a message to the Xbox Pred, who responded almost instantly. She joined his Xbox Party Chat where he was with a 9 year old. She invited me. I joined the chat and instantly confronted the Xbox Pred. As expected, he ran away and left the chat. We weren‚Äôt done. So eventually, we got him to join our Xbox Party Chat to explain himself. He did apologize and said he won‚Äôt do it again. But he didn‚Äôt really explain himself. At first, he claimed that he didn‚Äôt know the girl was 16, etc. After reading the chat logs between him and the 16 year old, he apologized. But I feel his apology was empty.

Soon enough, I invited Allie to the Xbox Party Chat so she can confront him and so he could personally apologize to her. In the Xbox chat, Allie told me the Xbox Pred also hit on her friend, StarGirl, who is 11. There was no denying that this wasn‚Äôt his first time. Eventually, the Xbox Pred left the Xbox Party Chat and blocked all of us.

The second-place winner (Lifecheck) and the third-place winner (Apunch) also made CRAZY levels that truly bend the limits of what is considered a "Stereo Madness Remake" - in the best way!

If I worked for Xbox Enforcement... Things would've been different on Xbox. Some people would agree with me, others wouldn't. I change up the Xbox Enforcement Team's priorities. Pirating games isn't as bad as scamming someone on Xbox. A multi billion dollar company won't go bankrupt if someone pirated one of their games. Really, would the game publisher care that much? Sure, it's bad but it's not worse than scamming someone on the Xbox Network.

I made a video like this before a while ago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zmd_nkx66Y&ab_channel=sacramentolove
But the video was bad and I figured I needed to eventually remake it. Besides, I needed a video out to give me time to upload something better. Working at Xbox Enforcement had always been something I sometimes daydreamed about. What if I worked there? What if I was the head? Complaints would be taken more seriously, depending on the category.

In terms of scamming on Xbox? That would NOT fly by me. I would make sure every person who was scamming at some point would get permanently banned from the Xbox Network. Xbox Hackers and cheaters would be given a slap on their hands but if they were caught hacking again, they would be banned. Same goes for any crimes that take place on the Xbox Network or anything that is against the Xbox Community Standards or Xbox Code of Conduct.

Description: Pi AI Review: First Impressions and Comparison with Google Bard & ChatGPT | ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Char Rivel Pi launches on Android

Is Pi AI the new king of chatbots?

In this video, I put the brand new Pi AI to the test and share my first impressions. I also compare Pi with Google Bard and ChatGPT in terms of friendliness, mobile experience, and overall performance.

Here's what I found:

Pi AI:

More friendly and engaging: Pi has a unique personality that makes it feel more like a friend than a machine. It's witty, playful, and always willing to help.
Mobile-first design: Pi's interface is clean, intuitive, and designed specifically for mobile users. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the clunky mobile experiences of Bard and ChatGPT.
Strong potential: Pi is still under development, but it has already learned to perform many tasks well. I'm excited to see how it evolves in the future.

Google Bard:

Powerful and informative: Bard is a powerhouse of information and can generate comprehensive and informative responses.
Academic tone: Bard can be a bit dry and academic at times, making it feel less personable.
Desktop-focused: Bard's interface is designed for desktops and can be cumbersome to use on mobile devices.

ChatGPT:

Creative and versatile: ChatGPT is a creative writing powerhouse and can generate a wide range of text formats.
Can be prone to factual errors: ChatGPT is not always accurate and can sometimes generate factually incorrect information.

Overall:

I'm impressed with Pi AI and believe it has the potential to be a game-changer. It's friendly, mobile-first, and has a lot of potential. However, it's still under development and needs some work before it can compete with the likes of Bard and ChatGPT.

Description: When it comes to artificial intelligence, what are we actually creating? Even those closest to its development are struggling to describe exactly where things are headed, says Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, one of the primary architects of the AI models many of us use today. He offers an honest and compelling new vision for the future of AI, proposing an unignorable metaphor ‚Äî a new digital species ‚Äî to focus attention on this extraordinary moment.

Description: In this AI experiment, I bridge the virtual gap between OpenAI's ChatGPT, now equipped with voice functionality, and Inflection AI's conversational maestro, Pi. The dialogue sheds light on the potential and current state of conversational AI technology. Although there's a tad bit of latency, the exchange underscores how far AI has come in understanding and responding in a human-like manner. As ChatGPT and Pi volley remarks, we catch a glimpse of a future where voice assistants like Siri and Alexa may improve their current capabilities, becoming more interactive and helpful.

Description: This woman's family planned the perfect prank for her during the holidays. Her daughter had gotten a pair of tiny fake hands and everybody got around to see how long it would take for the woman to notice them. While her mother unknowingly showed her photographs on her phone, the daughter was literally standing next to her and placed her fake hands on the table. She even brushed her mother's head with the fake hands. The woman's sibling, however, soon began laughing aloud, which left the woman perplexed as to why they were laughing at her. While the family continued to laugh at her, she took a really long time to notice that her daughter had fake hands the whole time.

üåü FAQ:

Q) How is your face always in the centre?
A) I stabilized each photo manually, frame by frame (notice how the borders are always moving?). It took me around 50+ hours in total for this video. I posted a video explaining the process in detail here: https://youtu.be/FGXGHYonfGM?t=2m16s

Q) Why don't you smile?
A) Mainly for consistency. From the beginning, I planned to have the same expression in every photo, and it's easier to keep a straight face than it is to smile in the same way each time. Secondly, I wanted to capture the physical changes in my face, while avoiding the emotional changes in my life. 

Q) Why did you start? What gave you the idea?
A) In 2008, I watched Noah Kalina's project here on YouTube, and I decided to start my own that focuses on myself aging, since I was still young at the time. I was also motivated by wanting to document my life, and to be able to show this to my family in the future.

Q) Do you plan to keep going forever? Will you ever stop?
A) I have no intention of stopping. The plan is to continue this project forever.

Q) Where are you from?
A) I was born in London, England, but have spent most of my life in Canada. I'm currently living in Fredericton, Canada.

Q) How old were you when you were married?
A) I was 21, but turned 22 less than a month later.

Q) How did you graduate High School at 16 / start college at 17?
A) I'm not some kind of genius, I just went to high school in Montreal, where it ends in Grade 11 (one year earlier than the rest of Canada and the USA). I was also born right before the cutoff, so I was younger than everybody else. As for college, in Quebec, there's something called CeGep, which is basically a middle ground between High School and University. We refer to it as College. So unfortunately, I wasn't a child prodigy as many comments seemed to think, lol.

Description: I tried playing the 1.0 release of Minecraft and it was a buggy mess, it makes sense, because every game on release has so many bugs that it's unplayable. So I disagree with people who say the old Minecraft is better, because most of those people haven't actually played it recently, so they only remember the good sides, which I guess there was a few. Overall modern Minecraft is incomparably better with the solid mob pathfinding in 1.21 and none of the bugs I mentioned in the video.
I respect you liking to play whatever version you want, but please don't say that "you miss the old Minecraft". JUST PLAY IT.

My Hunter: @ItsBent 

Minecraft Manhunt is a challenge where a Speedrunner must beat the game before their hunter kills them, made popular by Dream. However, most of his manhunts have rules that change the challenge to be a completely different game. So I did a manhunt with my friend with no rules to spice things up.

I hope to do more challenges like this in the future and challenge other Manhunt youtubers to manhunts, as well as some very strong players. Subscribe if you want to see those.

I killed the rarest mob in minecraft on my live stream, this will cause pain.

Minecraft has a lot of rare things, but Minecraft's rarest mob has an unbelievable chance! Today I got all of the rarest Minecraft mobs, and used Minecraft mechanics to destroy them! My audience didn't know that the rarest Minecraft mob in history was waiting at the end! This Minecraft stream triggered my Minecraft live stream viewers!

Not every character had enough lines to shine as a stand-alone. Hope you like this, it is not the most cheery show in the world so this is like a breath of fresh air! Rhodey is next btw i have his video for 80% ready.

I used the program "VoiceAttack" so that whenever I say a mob's name in Minecraft, it will spawn 10 of that mob. I also added commands where if I swear in Minecraft I die and if I say a biome or a natural disaster I will teleport to it. This time it's if I say the name of a Minecraft Biome it gets deleted from the game. This was inspired by DougDoug's Skyrim, but if I say "dragon" then 10 dragons spawn video but in Minecraft instead but mobs spawn if I say their name.

Description: The power of the Jedi vs Marvels Avengers


The Jedi master and their apprentice travel the lands in search of something of lots of value to them - tire caps. Master Obi Wan and Anakin face a dangerous threat known as the Avengers on their mission, lead by Captain America, which puts their mission in jeopardy. For the sake of the tire caps, will Anakin and Obi Wan try to escape, or will they use their Jedi powers and lightsabers to fight, even if it means being tempted by the dark side?

Description: Full colour Minecraft in Minecraft running on my redstone computer IRIS has been a dream of mine.
I have been working on this program for over 4 months. I hope it is worth the wait!

After I made DOOM run on IRIS, I knew Minecraft would be possible too.

IRIS is a fully programmable 16 bit redstone computer.
Meaning IRIS is capable of running even more games and programs than this!
Subscribe for future videos of IRIS running even more cool stuff!

IRIS does not use any command blocks or datapacks and is fully functional in vanilla Minecraft.
The colour screen uses retextured redstone dust which gives me 16 different colours to use by changing the signal strength.

Minecraft Program Features:
- 8x8x8 block world
- Unrestricted 3d movement and camera rotation
- Jumping and gravity
- Placing and breaking blocks
- Animated breaking and placing
- 11 types of blocks
- 11 types of items
- Functional hotbar and inventory
- Crafting system with both 2x2 and 3x3 grids supported
- Inventory supports moving stacks, merging stacks and moving single items

The 2048 Instruction limit on IRIS is why I had to get creative to add the "functional TNT". I would have added even more features such as ores and the furnace but the instruction limit prevented me.

Description: Xbox Threatened to BAN Me. Many times, someone sees me on YouTube and decides to impersonate Xbox staff by making fake Xbox gamertags, and using it to fool me and possibly extort me for my personal information. Who knows. But I hate it when people think I'm stupid enough to fall for this. Actually, WHO would fall for this? To these Xbox scammers or whatever think someone will fall for this?

So after my Xbox Console Ban, I uploaded a rant or just an update to YouTube. Then I followed tradition by uploading a video explaining why I was banned. At least that's what the Xbox Enforcement Safety Propaganda team told me through an email. At now, I find a message I sometimes get from people who are either Xbox Scammers or Xbox Trolls, thinking this little thing would work... Similar to when Xbox told me to stop making videos. Except it wasn't the real Xbox. Lol.

Xbox never directly says why you were banned. They usually very vague. After the implementation of the Xbox Strike System, they're even more VAGUE. If they say you were banned for written or verbal communications, then you could've been banned for anything. You won't truly know what exactly you did and won't be able to learn from your mistakes or intentions. What a wonderful and flawless enforcement system at Xbox. Be vague about Xbox Enforcement action and make the player spend a lifetime, thinking why they were Xbox Console Banned. Genius! :D

Description: Earlier this year the first known public exploit for the Xbox One was released. Known as 'Collateral Damage' this exploit allowed for, the very first time, games to be decrypted and dumped. This has led to development of an emulation or a translation layer to be developed that can run Xbox One games on a Windows 10 or 11 PC. In today's episode we take a look at XWine1 the first Xbox One translation layer in development for Windows, however this is not the only one in development. We discuss what's been happening in the Xbox One hacking scene, dumping games, translation layers and much more!

Xbox Account Thief Tries to Hack Me. And he did kinda hack me but that‚Äôs only because I let him. Granted, I didn‚Äôt send him my real account information. I made a Smurf account. But I guess that little trick did not make him happy, so he blocked me AFTER getting banned. Yes, the Xbox Account Thief got banned while I was in a party chat with him but not because of stealing and hacking Xbox accounts. He was banned because of a message that was reported by one of his friends. Since saying swear words is a whole lot worse than stealing and hacking other people‚Äôs Xbox accounts. Go, Microsoft!

I was in the Xbox LFG, and I saw a post that read ‚ÄúI will mod your account for free be legit.‚Äù Obvious red flag. It‚Äôs unlikely someone would mod a GTA account for free but on top of that, trusting a stranger on Xbox to let them access your Xbox account? Not many players would fall for something like this. But the Xbox Looking for Groups has young minds in it that don‚Äôt fully understand that there are messed up people on the Xbox Network. So obviously, I got interested in the Xbox Account Thief‚Äôs post and he messaged me. He was very insisted on getting me email and password. But I wanted to get him in an Xbox Party Chat first.

The Xbox Account Thief did send me an Xbox Party Chat invite, and vaguely explained the process of modding accounts. He claimed to have done it through Rockstar Games‚Äô social club but that was a lie. He was hacking real Xbox Accounts, not just modding GTA accounts. He showed off one of the accounts he stole which he claimed belonged to him, and used it to try to convince me that he can mod accounts. He showed me a blue jeep with modded wheels in GTA. Someone who mods Xbox accounts for free wouldn‚Äôt be so pushy and insistent. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the Xbox Account Thief claimed that he mods Xbox accounts for free because he doesn‚Äôt like it when people use their money. Meanwhile‚Ä¶ the Xbox Accounts he hacks and steals may contain payment information. So the irony here is sky high.

I created a Smurf Xbox Account to troll the Xbox Account Thief. I quickly made an email, and created an Xbox Account, opened up GTA from my Xbox game library, then signed out. I sent the login information of that Smurf account to the Xbox Account Thief. This little stunt did upset him and he just kept blocking me. I don‚Äôt know if did steal the Xbox Account. It was working yesterday but the next day, the password seemed to be correct but my Xbox kept giving me an error.  I don‚Äôt know what happened but the Xbox account was worth NOTHING. It had no stored games, no stored personal information, no stored payment information, nothing. It was a completely smurf Xbox account that wasn‚Äôt even worth taking, even by the Xbox Account Thief‚Äôs standards.

So the Xbox Account Thief eventually blocked me. I decided to message the friends that were on his account. I only messaged 2 of them since they were the only ones online at the time. The first one never responded. The second friend responded because his brother was a victim of the Xbox Account Thief. The victim messaged me and told me the Xbox Account Thief hacked his Xbox Account. While the way he explained it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. I‚Äôm pretty sure the Xbox Account Thief convinced the victim that he‚Äôs modding accounts, and gained his trust for login information but no one really knows. At the end, I directly messaged the Xbox Account Hacker but he did not have a lot to say and eventually stopped talking to me.

How Xbox Account Thieves are JACKING Accounts. It‚Äôs no longer a case of social engineering or brute force attacks on Xbox accounts. It‚Äôs a simple technique made by Microsoft but is being abused by the Xbox Account Thieves. It is a simply code made by Microsoft and exploited by Xbox Account Hackers. The victim is given a code, after entering that code in a Microsoft portal, they ultimately unknowingly give account access to the hacker or thief. I‚Äôve seen this a few times before but it seems much more common on Xbox now.

In Xbox LFG, I found a post that claimed to be giving away a free modded GTA Xbox account. I knew there was some kind of catch but I played along and got interested. The Xbox Account Thief sent me a link to a Microsoft link page. He generated a code and prompted me to type in that code, followed by clicking ‚ÄúAllow Access‚Äù which would give the Xbox Account Thief access to my Xbox Account. I didn‚Äôt type in the code but I knew what comes next. After that, I was prompted to type in my password. He was telling me I‚Äôll get a modded Xbox account this way. But honestly, he was just wanting me to allow access to my Microsoft account.

After typing the code in and typing in my password, the Xbox Account Thief would instantly get access to my Microsoft account/Xbox account. This would enable them to reset my password, change the email, and lock me out of the account so they can steal it and perhaps sell it. On Microsoft‚Äôs page, it specifically says not to enter a code from a source(s) you don‚Äôt trust. But that doesn‚Äôt mean someone wouldn‚Äôt fall for this. Microsoft‚Äôs only warning on this exploit is to not use the code from another person you don‚Äôt trust. But I figured a video might help some players out.

I looked more into this and discovered Microsoft made code sharing for the sole purpose of sharing files, documents, etc. But I couldn‚Äôt find how these codes are being generated. So on Twitter, I asked you guys for some help. I was told these codes are simply generated from a different device to quickly link accounts on secondary devices. It‚Äôs supposed to be a quick and convenient way of signing into an account on a different device. Now Xbox Account Thieves and Xbox Account Hackers are abusing it to steal Xbox accounts.

Do NOT enter codes from sources you don't trust. This includes other players that you don‚Äôt know because your Xbox account could instantly get compromised. Stay safe!

Now to call this a "black market" might be much, it's just a bunch of idiots trying to sell access to their Discord . But is it even worth buying? And what is Discord going to do about it?

Hey ya'll! Today im using a crafting table to lag out a really pay-to-win minecraft server, owned by Loverfella, a pretty cringe youtuber. Its been 2 years since ive done a quick one off server crashing video like this, and it sure as heck is nostalgic. Its time to take a step back from all of the chaotic big youtuber generic clickbait spam and get back to my roots: stopping P2W. Ever since Mojangs enforcement of Pay-to-win, I didn't see much of a point of uploading antip2w but their enforcement sucks and pay to win still thrives and still sucks. This is some really old footage, but fear not as all the info on their webstore is completely up to date. They are still P2W, and they still suck.
Apologies if this video was scuffed asf. I did this in a day, which is a big contrast to the weeks I spend on videos. Also please don't harass the staff, they are mostly kids who just want to help moderate their favorite server. A bit like petco staff. No need to be unnecessarily harsh to them.

[IMPORTANT] Here is a document defining what the general community thinks is P2W, and also explains how you can make YOUR server not P2W, in 30 community translated languages!: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rd8vkKvpln6uhgO4XIUctWS5VkaxyZRc0h8Bb9GaxLI/edit?usp=sharing

HAPPY PRIDE MONTH CHATTERS!! Sadly I am not gay (proven by the quiz).

I love streaming games with either my friends, or games where I talk and communicate with chat. I cannot post these VODS on youtube since they will get copy striked for the music (trust me, I already tried!), but you can watch them with the music on Twitch. Follow me so I can work to reach Affiliate in order to make better content for everyone!

I apologize for the low quality on the Minecraft videos, my computer can only handle streaming most games at 720p and 30fps!


JessWithTheS, cause its jess, but with all the s's, so people say like, ya know, "oh, jess with all the s's?", hahahaha, laugh after you read this and nod your head like you get it.

Next video, I will be 1v1 PvP'ing Dream (from Minecraft) and playing Roblox with (Ethan) CrankGameplays (from Markiplier). (not kidding). In the next next video, I will be decoding the trilogy of the QSMP drama I found on 4chan. I have the answers i swear

A Minecraft, but challenge for adults above your legal drinking age. I ain't no Dream Team stan, but might have to send some kissy wissy's to @Sapnap after blessing my ears.

This is a Minecraft but, 1.14/1.15/1.16/1.17/1.18/1.19 challenge that you should NEVER do. This was super fun and crazy awesome! Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin. I copied this entire paragraph from a GeorgeNotFound video.

this is a reminder you are loved and cared about :)

The Saucy Boys have a long standing tradition where they go to Fort Lauderdale & South Beach twice a year to indulge in fine Italian cuisine, and drink hella beers. Unfortunately, this time around Pier had to back out last minute due to school obligations. This was bad enough on it's own, what made it worse was that Al Dente informed me that my sister @lyndalessandro would be taking his place. Oh yeah, and he didn't tell me till the morning of... probably because he knew I would've try to shut it down. It's called a BOYS TRIP, THAT MEANS NO GIRLS. If she wants to be an honorary bro, she needs to prove herself worthy. Welcome to your hell night @lyndalessandro , you wanna become part of the pack? well, it requires a sacrifice... of your sanity.

Description: Playing the Legacy4J mod for Minecraft Java edition which recreates console legacy Minecraft on PC with the new Minecraft update features. 

This mod was created by Wilyicaro and you can check out the page for it here - https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/legacy-minecraft

It‚Äôs amazing what this mod has achieved. The lighting engine was entirely redesigned to look the exact same as legacy Minecraft used to look before it was discontinued for Bedrock edition. The gamma slider is functional in this mod. You are able to use a controller. The legacy menus and crafting has been implemented. The legacy custom superflat worlds are also in this mod allowing you to create fun and unique worlds for a challenge. There is also the tutorial world and many more features to explore in this mod so check it out for yourself and have a play around of all the things it adds to the game and brings back from console. 

Hope you enjoyed the video and found this mod exciting! If you want more nostalgic Minecraft legacy videos to watch consider subscribing and like the video to support my channel. Thanks for watching :))

Description: I survived 4000 Days in Hardcore Minecraft, this is what happened...

This video is intended for audiences 13+ years old for the following reasons
Fantasy Violence
Violent References
Suggestive Themes
Crude Humor

Minecraft Hardcore Mode is the HARDEST version of Minecraft without a doubt. Creepers spawn more often. Skeleton arrows do more damage. And Zombies can call upon the horde. Most notably of all though, if you die in Hardcore Minecraft, you die forever. Your world is deleted. *Minecraft theme plays at MAX VOLUME*

Thank you to all my subscribers you are all amazing! If you want to become one hit that sub button!

We don't know where they came from. We don't know how they got here. But we do know this: they're here to play! Rabbids are curious little creatures that have invaded earth, and they're on a mission‚Ä¶to have fun and leave a giant path of destruction wherever they go.

Whether they're stealing bananas from the mall, playing with plungers, or climbing cows, these little Rabbids are fury friends of very few words, and love fighting with each other on all of their crazy adventures. There‚Äôs only one thing they all agree on... elevators are super confusing.

Description: Playing legacy Minecraft Nintendo Switch edition, which was removed from the Nintendo eShop not long after launch due to the release of Bedrock.

This version of Minecraft on Nintendo Switch came out in 2017 and only those who bought it before they released Bedrock in 2018 are still able to go back and play it on their accounts. The game never had a physical release making it even harder to get these days as only someone who bought the digital edition in the year it was out will have the game. This video I played the legacy minigames and explored through the latest tutorial world on Nintendo Switch before going onto some of my old survival and creative worlds that I used to build on in 2017. Lots of nostalgia for this version as the early days of the Switch being out gave me the best memories and it was awesome finding other people playing this online with me. If you have any ideas for videos or streams I could do on this leave a comment :)

To celebrate the upcoming Release of GTA 6. I recreated Grand Theft Auto in Hardcore Minecraft. But there is a twist! It's the old GTA 5, with the Los Santos, Vinewood, Mount Chilliad and many more locations recreated in Survival Minecraft. This is a new original Hardcore Serie idea like Beppo, Sandiction and Wunba. Not Rekrap2 or ParrotX2 with The LifeSteal SMP or Hermitcraft with MumboJumbo and Grian. I Built GTA V (GTA 5) in Minecraft, NOT GTA VI (GTA 6) in Minecraft Hardcore, that would be a completely different concept you silly goose reading this.

Description: Did you know that LEGO Marvel‚Äôs Avengers‚Äô New York hub is copied from a different game?

0:00 Intro
0:15 Explanation
0:25 X-Mansion, Daily Bugle & Baxter Building
0:33 Character Billboards
0:37 Helicarrier
0:44 Oscorp & Fisk Tower
0:51 Outro

While it also includes Washington, D.C., a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Tony Stark‚Äôs mansion, Clint Barton‚Äôs safehouse, Asgard, Sokovia and South Africa, its Manhattan map is taken straight out of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, blinking Statue of Liberty and all. Well, not all of it.

You see, as this game primarily adapts the Marvel Cinematic Universe, TT Games opted to remove references to parts of Marvel that weren‚Äôt, at least, at the time, part of the MCU, like the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool.

Notable changes include the X-Mansion being replaced by the Avengers Compound, the Daily Bugle losing its branding and the Baxter Building being outright deleted from existence. Even billboards featuring specific characters have been taken over by Roxxon and Pym.

It also extends to the Helicarrier, which is pretty much identical except for you losing flight privileges and Deadpool‚Äôs room being replaced by a portal to the Collector‚Äôs room.

And while Spider-Man did end up being added to the game in a free character pack, his villains weren‚Äôt so lucky, with both Oscorp and Fisk Tower similarly being replaced. It also takes place during the sunset instead of midday, which looks pretty neat!

Videogame Scams are a huge problem within the online gaming world. There's all different types that range from little V-buck/Robux scams, all the way to attacks that can steal personal info, thousands of dollars, and ruin lives. So in this video I'm going to be testing and investigating some of these scams myself that occur in different games like Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, Call of duty, etc. I Wanted to make a video similar to the commentary style of RT60, Leon Talks a Lot, Ramsker, and Toonarii. Also I know you guys liked my Videogames That Fell Off video so i‚Äôm trying to create similar content. If yall enjoyed the video feel free to drop a like and sub, thanks!

Today Me, Jack Manifold, Tubbo & Average Harry installed the Fortnite into our computers! This is the new OG Fortnite played by Ninja, Lazarbeam and other fun YouTubers. This is absolutely not Minecraft 1.19! Even though I had a Minecraft War with some other YouTbers on the Dream SMP Minecraft Server, today Slimecicle did NOT join the call but he is just hilarious and we had lots of laughs. This was so fun, awesome, poggers and cool! This Minecraft Mod, wait, I meant Fortnite, haha! Fun. Funny mistake. I make funny mistakes sometimes. Some of them you know about. Some of them you don't. Fun! I love Fortnite fun. 

This is absolutely not The Funniest Minecraft Video Ever with New Funny Mods makes Minecraft 1.19 even funnier & hilarious! It is lots of fun and laughs :) 

This is absolutely Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me and my good friends playing the NEW FUNNIEST MINECRAFT MOD EVER!!! POG CHAMP!!!

Description: Building Embedded Systems with AOSP - Why You Should Consider, Best Practices and Pitfalls - Anna-Lena Marx, inovex GmbH

In our community, building embedded systems based on Linux, e.g. with Yocto or buildroot, is standard and well known. Considering Android, respectively the AOSP as a base system feels strange at the beginning as it is a huge ecosystem that implies high system requirements. Of course, embedded Android is not a solution for each issue. Nevertheless, the AOSP provides a sophisticated base platform which is packed with a - modern UI stack - robust media and camera implementation - modern AI runtime - well known abstraction between system and app development - energy optimization and lots of other helpful infrastructure. This makes AOSP an interesting approach for building more complex embedded systems. A first goal of this talk is to show in which situations choosing AOSP over a plain Linux system really adds value and where not. But where to start and how are the best workflows? The AOSP is a massive and complex code base with a few hundred GB of source code. Navigating the sources, finding the right place to do changes and working with several code repositories at once is a tough task at the beginning. Thus, the second goal of this talk is to share best practices and hints to avoid lots of pitfalls from 8 years of doing embedded Android projects in different setups and sizes.

For many, #linux  meets their needs... but this isn't true for everyone. There are some programs that have no replacements. Creative types especially have this problem... Linux does many things, but audio is not one of them. There are several other reasons that keep people tied to platforms like #windows10, #windows11 and #MacOS. 

#linuxgaming has also come a long way, but modding support isn't fully there yet. This may or may not matter.

Let's discuss all the reasons I'm stuck on linux... and I'm just writing nonsense at this point. I hope I got enough fancy words into this thing to make it beat the all-go-rhythm (I'm afraid to type the real word because... what if THEY are watching!).

I decided to watch the 'A Minecraft Movie' Teaser in 0.25x speed. Not the animated version, but real human version, where I discuss the Jumanji dilemma with Jack Black and a trailer with a lot of facts, easter eggs and hidden messages.

It's not the Minecraft I usually do, and the Dream like fast Minecraft Speedrunner VS 3 Hunters GRAND FINALE or Minecraft, But Item Drops Are Random And Multiplied... It's just me watching the teaser and telling you about what happens in it.

Also thanks and credits to Warner Bros. Pictures, Historical Game Content, Alumio, Coolguyapf and MinecraftHUB, which I've used some clips and information from!

Description: This was meant as a companion video to hike No. 7 (this used to be a hiking channel). It features a slightly extended version of the encounter with the kitten (I ended up using way more of it in the episode than originally intended). Additionally we check out briefly how the little cat is doing over the next several weeks.

Check out the hike itself to find out what I've been through. At the end of the day my watch was showing over 30K hiked (30 km == 18.6 miles). My ability to handle this pure cuteness was greatly limited, I was physically exhausted, never had a chance.

We thought it would be funny to design a crate with the capabilities of sending Pier cross country. With airline tickets being out of control, it only seemed reasonable to try our luck and give him the trip to Europe he's always wanted. The confusion and gaslighting reaches levels previously thought impossible, in grand Saucy Fusilli fashion.

Channel Name: Galaxius
Description: Youtube and others want their users to disable adblockers to increase their revenue from advertisements, but will forcing the users to so do be effective in the long-term? 

What unexpected consequences could occur? Why do people use adblockers in the first place? Why aren't more users buying Youtube Premium as a solution? Do adblock users still contribute value to websites? Can websites effectively enforce such policies? Are there ways to naturally encourage more users to disable their adblockers instead?

Enjoy my informal and assorted ramblings as I learn basic video editing skills. 

For more examples of the Cobra Effect, here is a playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lUrH4Sbgh8&list=PLBuns9Evn1w9XhnH7vVh_7C65wJbaBECK

Be aware: The publisher of this series, Reason TV, hit the nail on the head with exploring this concept, but they do have a heavy libertarian bias, and I do not agree with everything that they publish. Be aware before you watch a series that could alter your recommendations.

Supplemental links and sources will (slowly) be updated here. I should have done so in the first  place, but future videos won't have this issue.

Channel Name: SaucyTV
Description: You may or may not know, but Marco is a professor at St. John's University (somehow). Marco & his brother Pier have been collaborating with St. John's on many projects associated with emerging media and content creation. Their eventual goal was to merge SaucyTV & the St. John's Media Department to create something brand new and never before seen...

Marco has been in talks with the board of directors about potentially expanding the communications department to now include "content creation" as an academic discipline. This would make St. John's the first college in New York to offer such a curriculum. After months of paperwork, meetings, and bureaucratic deliberation, he finally assembled all the key players necessary in making this dream a reality. For the most important pitch of his life, Marco would make the mistake of trusting his brother Pier to present the case study that would decide if they got funding or not to lead this new department.

While Marco was handling the business side of things, Pier conjured up something diabolical to swap at the last minute with the presentation him & Marco agreed on showcasing.

Let's just say the question is no longer "will they get the funding for this department" and is now instead, "Will Marco keep his job after this?"

At least we can say the presentation was unbelievable, no matter which way you look at it.

This is: Pier's Epic Lecture

Description: How I'm storing hundreds of gigabytes of files on Discord, for free! I wrote a server in NodeJS and a frontend in React that lets me upload any file of any size to Discord, then download it later. Works great! And even hides tax evasion evidence from the IRS!

Don't do this yourself, I didn't actually read Discord TOS but if I had I'm pretty sure it says not to do this. I'm not releasing the code (mostly because it is bad) but also because really don't do this

Description: ***best to be viewed in 4k to see all the details***
The purpose of this dashboard arranged film is to give a better overview on the timeline of the events unfolding on 11 September 2001. The footage and events are synchronized in realtime. The film starts exactly one hour before the first plane hits the World Trade Center.

The video starts at 07:46:40 am (1h before the first impact).

The screen is divided into various sectors:

Live TV broadcast
TV coverage of different TV stations (ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, NBC).

Latest Events
All event which happened in this time window. Information taken mostly from Wikipedia.

Timeline Major Events
27:14 AA11 hijacked
55:58 UA175 hijacked
59:55 AA11 crashes into WTC1
1:03:15 AA77 hijacked
1:16:17 UA175 crashes into WTC2
1:41:15 UA93 hijacked
1:51:01 AA77 crashes into the Pentagon
2:12:15 WTC2 collapsed
2:16:26 UA93 crashes in Somerset County, PA
2:41:37 WTC1 collapsed

Radio Window
Indicates when radio of either New York City Fire Department or Air Traffic Control is played.

Clock
Actual time during the events in EST Eastern Standard Time (GMT-4).

Information Board
Mostly, the board shows the flight paths and positions of the air planes. Also movie footage and photos which could be time-synced are shown. Additional information to the TV footage, audio or events are overlayed.

Status Monitor
Status of the airplanes (on the ground, airborne, hijacked, crashed) and buildings which have been impacted (WTC1, WTC2, Pentagon).

1:52:20 Another radio transmission from terrorist Ziad Jarrah aboard flight 93
1:54:25 The photograph "The Falling Man" is taken
2:28:33 Five stories of the pentagon collapse

Coincidences and Unusual Connections disovered in retrospect (not intentional foreshadowing):
9:00 Man in ad saying the he 's not jumping off the building. (Coincidental reference, not intentional foreshadowing)
13:22 Just after AA11 departed, a TV host says: "We have a breach in security." (Coincidental reference, not intentional foreshadowing)
16:36 President bush is leaving for his visit to Sarasota, not knowing he will be holding a difficult speech there about the attacks. 
17:00 "Three numbers that can save your life - 911" (Numerical coincidence)
18:23 An elderly couple is celebrating their 54th year of being married in New York. They got married in 47. 5+4=9, 4+7=11, (9/11) (Numerical coincidence)
27:55: During the hijacking of flight 11, an ad is showing a paper plane flying low through Manhattan. Inside of the plane is written: I'm on my way. Behind the woman who is throwing the paper plane is an artwork whose shape reminds of the twin towers (Ironic coincidence, not implying intentional foreshadowing)
31:55 CNN reports about an expansion project for the Capitol in Washington D.C. which was the target of Flight 93. (not intentional foreshadowing)
38:55 One of the last times the date "September 11th" has been spoken out without the relations to terrorist attacks. The man's voice cracked when he spoke it out. (Coincidental mention, not intentional foreshadowing)
51:49 CNN advertises a report: "When the big one hits", 8 minutes before flight 11 hits the WTC. (Scheduling coincidence, not implying intentional foreshadowing.)
52:04 The weatherman says that fortunately the hurricane moves away from the US. If it didn't move away, it may have prevented the terrorists planes taking off that day. (Speculative observation)
1:00:12 After 9/11, President Bush created the Office of Homeland Security. Tom Ridge, who is shown on screen just seconds after the first plane hit, became the first head of the office. (Historical fact, established in response to 9/11)
1:02:29 The flying papers flying around in the ad look very similar to the scene happening at the same time at the world trade center. (Observational similarity, not implying intentional foreshadowing)


Errors:
1:00:02 The photo on the information board is incorrect. It doesn't show Chief Joseph Pfeifer who made the radio message but his brother Lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer who died on 9/11.
2:13:27 The photo on the information board is incorrect. It doesn't show Chief Joseph Pfeifer who made the radio message but his brother Lieutenant Kevin Pfeifer who died on 9/11.

Description: ‚ñ∫Check out Pillow Fight using my link: https://pillowfight.sjv.io/DeepHumor

‚ñ∫The video has a pretty abrupt cut from 7:40-7:55, but I had to trim that part out because this video got copyright claimed. Basically in the part that I trimmed out, I said that my impersonator got banned and that I was so happy that I will finally be the only "DeepHumor" in youtube's algorithm. That's why I said afterwards, in present day, that it was depressing to hear me say that in 2018. Hope that makes sense.

‚ñ∫I might lose the name DeepHumor. A channel with the same name, which I believe is impersonating me, is demanding the name DeepHumor from me. Let me know what you guys think about this situation in the comments below.

If you have a persistent infostealer, or RAT it's usually easier to reinstall than any other method, if it was not persistent, focus straight away on resetting all of your sessions and passwords.

In addition, having 2 factor authentication is helpful, but it doesn't guarantee security when dealing with malware. Infostealers can steal the chrome cookies in addition to the passwords which usually is enough to login to a google account without 2 factor authentication.

Description: Rockstar Games has once again been exposed for using a Razor 1911 No CD Crack to bring the game Midnight Club 2 to Steam (Game is now delisted). But this isn't the first, nor the last time that publishers will turn to No CD cracks to bring their back catalog to digital storefronts. In today's episode we discuss!

Description: Portions of this video were released previously but never really told the FULL STORY of how a modern Apple AirTag collided head-on with a 250-year-old constitutional amendment - which ultimately resulted in a judge getting involved. I personally love seeing cases like this where patrol officers go into full detective mode - going above and beyond to develop the probable cause to request a search warrant - and, in this case, it was quickly signed off by a judge. Sometimes, the quiet, time-consuming and diligent work of law enforcement deserves a dedicated story like this!

Description: The latest PS5 system software update is here, version 10.00! That's a nice round number, and with it comes the Welcome Hub. Previously known as Explore in the US, the new page which was in beta is now going to go live for everyone with customizable widgets. And yes, everyone is going to get these features! Elsewhere on the change log we have Adaptive Charging for PS5 Slim and Pro consoles, the custom 3D Audio profiles, Party Share Invites, Restoring Licenses, and a few other things. Dollars to donuts, this one is pretty good. I'm not sure what that saying really means, but I think it fits here.

The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive.

This is the Google Pixel 3a XL and this is the only phone listed to be 100% compatible with Ubuntu Touch, arguable the very best and feature rich mobile Linux operating system available. This means all the hardware should work great from the camera, bluetooth, usb connectivity, everything. I used it as my main phone for an entire month.

How many USB devices can be plugged into a PC at one time? It's a reasonable question, but the answer is more complicated than you might expect. We took 127 USB devices and plugged them in one by one until something broke. Then we took those same devices and reconfigured a few things to see if we can break it a different way. Just how broken do things get? Which limits get hit? How can you calculate YOUR maximum USB amount?

[Verse 1: Jess Glynne]
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I rather be
I would wait forever, exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be [3x]

[Verse 2: Jess Glynne]
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I rather be

[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne]

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]

[Bridge]
Hmmmmmmmmmm, Hoooooooooo
Be [9x]
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah

Description: Youtube is a perfectly balanced platform with no exploits at all... Ok well maybe there are a few! Youtube is the greatest video sharing platform on the web and every now and again everyone finds a new way to exploit the website to glitch and bug the algorithm to become the largest channels on the website. In the 2010s we saw gaming channels accidentally use an algorithm glitch to become the only things youtube recommended. Now however youtube has a new secret exploit! There are many ways of explaining how to grow on youtube or how to get more views or how to get subscribers.

Description: Discord mod stalking you? Snot nosed Discord kiddo spamming you? Tired of all those Discord bots spamming your DMs when you join a server?

Well you've probably used Discord's block button to deal with those problems.

But Discord's blocking system is pretty weak. If a chronically online Discord user wanted to harass you, they could find a way around blocking you. And that's what Discord's new experimental features are trying to fix.

But since we're throwing it back to the good ol Discord news videos, I also talk about some useful and utterly useless features that Discord is working on.

We sat down with Speedify CEO Alex Gizis to discuss how drivers work on Apple vs Windows and Linux.

Let's spin up a server a simpler way.I'm experimenting with some background music, let me know what you think.In this video I will be showing how to use fundamentals to spin up a server, replacing cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Provider and Microsoft Azure with Linux, Docker and Git. For many applications, the tools we use are grossly over-engineered. I'm trying to force myself to rethink my approach and use simpler tools. Hosting this server is part of that.

In 1993 the world was introduced to Roshal Archive, or RAR ‚Äì a proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error recovery and file spanning. It was developed by Russian software engineer, Eugene Lazarevich Roshal, but the copyright for the file format is held by his brother Alexander. 

Two years later, we got WinRAR - a file archiver utility for Windows, which would be used to create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats, and also unpack a whole bunch of other archive file formats. 

WinRAR is distributed as a ''try before you buy'' software. According to the terms of use, you can use it for free during a 40 day trial period, after which you are required to buy a license. 

However, if you ever used WinRAR, you know that you can continue using it for free even after the 40 day trial period ends.

What CSS unit should you use for font size? In this video, I'll show you why you should not use the px unit for font-size, width, and height of elements. The px unit is not affected by the browser's base font size, and so is not accessible for users who want to increase the font-size by using that browser setting. For accessibility, it's better to use rem or em units

So far, it's been excellent and seems to deliver on all of its promises.

Also, hey @rossmanngroup, let me pay you. LOL. None of the payments seem to work, either through the app or via the website.

Corrections:
-  At 0:56 the descriptions for /bin and /usr/bin are historically correct, but on modern Linux distributions (e.g. beginning in Ubuntu 19.04), /bin is replaced with a symlink to /usr/bin (in a transition called "merged /usr" or "/usr merge") so both contain the same contents.

Channel Name: Crypto Finally Explained
Description: What is Odysee, YouTube alternative? Is decentralized YouTube possible?

YouTube has been plagued with many problems, such as unfair copyright strikes, numerous content creators being demonetized, or the never-ending mess with advertisers and their demands for what content should be incentivised or boycotted. Odysee saw this problem and offered a solution.

In this video, I‚Äôll explain what created the demand for a decentralized video sharing platform, how Odysee attempted providing such a service and how different it is from YouTube and other traditional video sharing platforms. To understand it, a proper look at LBRY, the foundation on which Odysee is built, is required. Therefore, I‚Äôll explain LBRY and its tokenomics.

Do you use Odysee? Do you think it has potential of eventually becoming the #1 content sharing platform? What are its drawbacks that stop it from becoming more popular? Share your insights in the comment section below!

Video ID: YqYUYKvXdFM
Channel Name: Naomi Brockwell TV
Description: When many people started getting their video channels deleted, I decided to really dig into some alternative platforms. One of them was LBRY, a truly decentralized video platform where content can't be deleted.

This is what happened:

- I now earn more on LBRY than YT
- LBRY 29k subs vs YT 36k
- Slightly less views per video on LBRY
- No videos are demonetized on LBRY
- My videos aren't taken down on LBRY

What is LBRY and what is the LBC currency that fuels it?
Paul Puey (Edge CEO) and I dive into the history, tech, & what's next for LBRY.

We also put our money where our mouths are: we each decide whether to invest $100. This is not investment advice, we're just giving you a peek into our own portfolios and how we make decisions for ourselves. Keep in mind, I'm more interested in the team, the tech, and whether it's a cool project than in short term gains.

If you‚Äôd like to see my extended interview with LBRY CEO Jeremy Kauffman where we talk about the secret algorithm and rating system exposed by ‚Äúreclaim the net‚Äù of a major video platform that is shadow banning certain users and promoting others, please head to the members content at https://NaomiBrockwell.com/memberships

Hot tip to content creators: setting up an account on LBRY.com takes 2 mins, and it‚Äôs a great side-revenue stream.

Description: Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at a new alarming feature that Microsoft wants to implement in upcoming versions of WIndows, a feature named Recall. This feature permits the system to take snapshots of your system to reflect on and becomes another useless feature powered by AI, should you switch to something more respectful? Probably.

Description: Today, we look at some bodycam footage of a woman's arrest that escalates into insanity almost immediately. From claiming Morgan Wallen will pay for her pizza, to stating that she is a retired NYPD police officer, I'm pretty sure she's telling the truth. Buckle up.

It's wild tracking down where these claims come from. It's also wild that I go on Twitter and get worked up about what people say when the whole platform is designed explicitly to amplify arguments! Anyway, we know cars are adding a ton of microplastics to the environment, but the transition to EVs only increases that negligibly if at all, and we should focus on the problem itself rather than some vague hope that we can somehow force Americans to start riding bikes and taking mass transit as we transition away from gas-powered vehicles!!!

Lyrics:
Oh I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
You'll never love me like you did
You'll never love
You'll never love me like you did

And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't want to love
I don't want to love you now
Oh how come all the best things fall apart

And it started pretty slowly
Oh when you asked about the old me
Oh, is she gone?
Oh, is she gone?
Oh I don't know
I think I left her somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go?
Where did we go?
Oh I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour we're driving off the edge
And darling now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Oh as I lay here by myself
And it's 4am I wonder
Did I put you through hell?
Oh no
I need to know if you're okay
I want to know, I need to know
If you're okay
Mmmm

And, I hope you that you're so damn sure
That leaving me was right
Best thing you ever did
It was leaving me behind
Woo ooo ooo
I couldn't blame you if I tried
I guess even the best things fall apart

Somewhere deep in you
Somewhere deep in me
Oh there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?

When I look at you
And when you look at me
Oh there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?
Who the hell are we?

Welcome to your Daily Dose of Internet where I search for the best trending videos, or videos people have forgotten about, and put them all in one video. I upload 2-3 times a week to keep video quality high. I always ask for permission to share videos that I find!

Also in this video, a person messes up when flipping a pancake. A person falls into a river. I show you a volcano eruption on a moon from Jupiter. I show you a very fuzzy plant. A bird tackles another bird. A guy hit his head and broke a light.

Thankfully Linux is around to bail me out and prevent this really nice tablet PC from becoming e-waste.

Thank you so much for watching! Hope you enjoyed it!


If you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly "comedy" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)

If you want to know HOW I make my videos including gear, lighting, all the tiddly bits that connect it all together, (with cheaper alternatives and kit I used to use), I've listed each item, what it's great at, and why I use it on the gear section of my website here:

Description: Tipping culture has definitely changed in the past decade and it's time to talk about it. I'm tired of paying someone to do their job when I'm not their employer, I want tips to actually be a gratuity. This video is just to help start and continue the conversation so please be nice to each other in the comments! I love you all!

Thank you everyone for all of the support! Anything you do, liking, subscribing, commenting, really helps out the algorithm so that more people can find me! Each interaction is one more closer to me getting a new mic :')

Hope you all enjoyed the video, this took forever to get out and I‚Äôve been working on it for quite a bit, really satisfying to finally be done with it though! I think next video I might talk about a quest in Fallout 4 that I really like, as compared to reviewing the whole game, also are you even reading at this point? hello.

#linux  #windowsapps #linuxdesktop #windows #technews 

I tried a few methods for Office. First, I went with Bottles, but it is a flatpak app, and as such is sandboxed, and doesn't have access to some system libraries, including Winbind.

I then moved on to the latest stable version of Wine, version 9.0. I followed a nice tutorial that felt like it could work, I left a link to it in the description.

https://ruados.github.io/articles/2021-05/office365-wine

But, after about 20 minutes, I got this error, which, looking at it online, seems to affect Windows users too, except I don't have the tools on Linux to fix the error, since it seems to require the windows control panel to fix.

Last thing I tried: installing Office 365 inside a Windows VM, and copying the files over. As expected, pasting all the Office related files in the respective directories in Wine's virtual C Drive didn't do anything, even after adding the few regedit changes mentioned by the online tutorial I found. 

Next was Adobe Photoshop. I tried using the PlayOnLinux built-in script, just to see, but it failed immediately, because it couldn't download the file.

I then decided to create a wine prefix to try and install it using basic Wine Stable. Nothing here, the installer never actually displays any window that I could interact with, it's stuck, and the terminal doesn't show any specific error or missing DLL I could try to fix.
Time to install things inside of a Windows VM, and to try copying the files over, because I've been told this can work.

I copied all the directories, and I tried running the photoshop executable from Bottles, and... it didn't work either. DLLs are missing from the install, for some reason or another, and can't be found.

https://linuxstans.com/adobe-photoshop-ubuntu/

Now, let's move on to Affinity Software, something a lot of people would love to see on Linux. I tried to run that installer with Wine inside of Bottles, but it fails immediately, apparently something like not having an icon in the installer, a required field not being there or something along those lines.
Trying to run it with Wine gives the same error, and also doesn't work.

Finally, I decided to give a shot to Autocad, another program often cited as a big missing piece for Linux. Trying to run the installer with Bottles failed immediately, a bunch of DLLS are apparently missing from the default Wine install.
app under Linux**

Now, I'm sure someone will mention here that I haven't tried Crossover, the paid tool made by Codeweavers, the biggest contributor to Wine. And that's why I'll mention them here: in their compatibility database, none of these programs are listed as supported either. The only one that could work is Photoshop CC 2019, that has a rating of 3 stars, which means "limited Functionality".

Neither Office 365, the latest Photoshop CC, Autocad 2020, or Affinity Designer or Photo work under Crossover either, and if it there was a single way, even ultra convoluted, to get these working, you know the developers of the PAID option would have built a script to make all the necessary changes, and they'd have advertised it heavily.

No, my cat doesn't really smoke, nor has she been declawed.

Description: Chinese app design looks weird. But, they work just as well as other apps and websites around the world. Why is that? I mean, it's cluttered, overwhelming for the eyes, and kinda just throws a bunch of things at you. Turns out, beneath the incredibly cluttered user interface lies undeniable psychology.

In this video, I cover why this "cluttered and weird" design is necessary, how physical space correlates with Chinese software design, why Chinese users might prefer mobile over desktop altogether, and how all of this impacts us.

LYRICS:

Oh I leave quite an impression 
Five feet to be exact
You‚Äôre wondering why half his clothes went missing 
My bodies where they‚Äôre at 
Now I‚Äôm gone but you‚Äôre still layin‚Äô 
Next to me 
One degree of separation
 
(I) Heard you‚Äôre back together and if that‚Äôs true 
You‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you‚Äôll 
Taste me 
Too 

Uh huh
 
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
(La la la la la la la)
He‚Äôs funny now all his jokes hit different 
Guess who he learned that from 
 
Now I‚Äôm gone but you‚Äôre still layin‚Äô
Next to me 
One degree of separation 
 
(I) Heard you‚Äôre back together and if that‚Äôs true 
You‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you‚Äôll 
Taste me 
Too 
 
(La la la la la la la)

Every time you close your eyes 
And feel his lips you‚Äôre feelin‚Äô mine 
And every time you breathe his air 
Just know I was already there 
You can have him if you like 
I‚Äôve been there done that once or twice 
And singin‚Äô ‚Äòbout it don‚Äôt mean I care 
Yeah I know I‚Äôve been known to share 
 
Well I heard you‚Äôre back together and if that‚Äôs true 
You‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissing you
If you want forever and I bet you do 
Just know you‚Äôll 
Taste me 
Too 

Taste me too 
(La la la la la la la)
You‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissing you
You‚Äôll just have to taste me when he‚Äôs kissing you

Description: Today I coded your terrible escape room ideas into Minecraft and forced a group of creators (and a massive group of fans) to complete it. You guys always have terrible ideas, so this ended up being super chaotic.

Huge thanks to @lafless for his help! Couldn't have done this project without him ü§å

*THIS MAP IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD!*
_Due to the way this map was coded, it is not prepared for release. Sorry!_

This escape room was coded entirely with the Skript server plugin (plus command blocks and Minecraft commands), and build with the Axiom Mod. You can find those projects here:

NOTES : For MacOS and BSD, I know MacOS's history involved a lot more such as NeXTSTEP/Mach OS/BSD/Darwin etc, but I only mentioned BSD because more people have heard of it and I didn't want to get into the whole evolution of Mac to keep the video shorter.

Description: How to make a CPU from scratch (any% speedrun glitchless):

1)  Get a rock.
2)  Smash the rock.
3)  Now you have 98% concentrated silicon dioxide.  Purify it to 99.9% pure silicon dioxide.   
4)  Purify it further to 99.9999999% polysilicon metal.
5)  Put the polysilicon ingots into a crucible.
6)  Heat the silicon ingots to 1698 ¬∞K.
7)  Take a small seed monocrystal and dip it into the vat of molten silicon.
8)  Slowly pull the crystal out as it cools.
9)  Now, you've a monocrystal of pure silicon.  Cut it into thin slices.
10) Now, you've got pristine freshly-cut silicon wafers.  Optionally, dope them with Boron, Phosphorus or another dopant.
11) Put photoresist on the wafer.
12) Take a chromium-etched photo-lithographic quartz mask with your desired circuit pattern and shine a laser beam through it to project the circuit pattern onto the wafer.
13) The locations of the shadows produced by the photo-mask will control where the photo-resist is chemically changed on the surface of the silicon wafer (depending on whether you used positive or negative photoresist). 
14) Now, develop the photoresist.
15) Acid etch the exposed parts of the wafer.
16) Perform countless iterations and repetitions of homo-epitaxy, hetero-epitaxy, pseudo-epitaxy, diffusion doping, copper interconnect layers, chemical mechanical polishing, photoresist applications, acid etching, and photomask exposing to build up the desired features on the wafer.
17) Now you've got a finished silicon wafer.  Cut it into pieces.
18) Now you've got un-packaged silicon dies.  Locate the pads on the silicon chip, and attach bond wires, or use the flip-chip method as is done now for most modern processors.
19) Use the bond wires or solder balls to provide an electrical connection between the pins on the chip package, and the pads on the silicon die.

And that's how you make a CPU.

Why were we forced to learn the recorder in school? It isn't that easy to play and it sounds awful, right? In this video, Sabrina explores the surprisingly rich history of the recorder and traces the instrument from its baroque origins all the way to the modern day. She challenges herself to play the recorder and even enlists the help of a professional recorder musician.

Algo spam (just the transcription of the video intro):

If you thought your private GitHub repositories were safe from prying eyes, think again.
This blog post caught my attention today, and I'm kind of surprised that no one's talking
about it because this seems like a big deal.
Anyone can access deleted and private repository data on GitHub.
Specifically, you can access data from deleted forks, deleted repositories, and even private
repositories on GitHub, and it's available forever.
This is known by GitHub and intentionally designed that way.
That's right, this is a feature, not a bug.

Oh, you make Minecraft videos? Do you make them on authentic, bespoke VCR's? Ermmm, yeah, didn't think so pal... (pushes up glasses)

Here's my funky, way-harder-than-it-should-be attempt at making one of those nostalgic Minecraft videos with the screenshots and the music and the stuff, etc. And, for the first time I'm going to show how I make VHS videos and what kind of convoluted BS I have to deal with.

Will this help me stop missing Sublime Text? Will my search for the perfect IDE stop here? To be determined.

Lyrics 

la-da-da-da, da-da-da 
la-da-da-da-da 
la-da-da-da, da-da-da

if i told you how much i think about her
you'd think i was in love
and if you knew how much i looked at her pictures 
you would think we're best friends

'cause i know her star sign, i know her blood type
i've seen every movie she's been in, and, oh god, she's beautiful and i know you loved her, and i know i'm butthurt
but i can't help it, no i can't help it

i'm so obsessed with your ex (uh-huh)
i know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and i can feel it
i'm starin' at her like i wanna get hurt
and i remember every detail you have ev–µr told me, so be careful, 
baby i'm so obs–µssed with your ex (ah)
yeah, i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)

la-da-da-da, da-da-da
she's got those lips, she's got those hips the life of every fuckin' party
she's talented, she's good with kids
she even speaks kindly about me (ah-ah)

and i know you love me, and i know it's crazy
but every time you call my name, i think you mistake me for her 
you both have moved on, you don't even talk
but i can't help it, i got issues, i can't help it, baby

i'm so obsessed with your ex
i know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and i can feel it
i'm starin' at her like i wanna get hurt
and i remember every detail you have ever told me, 
so be careful, baby 
i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
yeah, i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)

is she friends with your friends? is she good in bed?
do you think about her? no i'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
 is she easy-going? never controlling?
well-traveled? well-read? oh god, she makes me so upset

i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
she's been asleep on my side of your bed (ah, woah)
i'm so obsessed with your ex (god, she makes me so upset) 
i'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

Description: Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time with me talking about your computer safety once again. With Android being the largest platform in the world it's a shame some of the signing keys have been leaked. Signing keys allow malware to stay hidden and installed on software without a passing glance. Why is this a bad thing? Let's find out! Thanks for watching!

Lyrics:

It‚Äôs written on your face 
So why you wanna wait now? 
Just get it over
Oh, just get it over
Is it so hard to say?
That you don‚Äôt wanna stay here 
No, there‚Äôs no ¬´see you later¬ª anymore

Don‚Äôt wanna talk to nobody 
If can‚Äôt lay next to your body 
Get me out of this party 
Where do I go from here?
I know you said that you‚Äôre sorry 
Heard you say that you love me 
So why then you go off running?

Your words so clear
But I can‚Äôt hear
Anything
Cause I know, I know, I know what‚Äôs coming
My biggest fear
Is so sincere
Are you gone, you gone, you gone In the morning?

Said it‚Äôs for the better
That we‚Äôre not together 
Thought this was forever 
And ever, and ever
Wish you didn‚Äôt tell me anything 
I don‚Äôt wanna know if this is real
Is this the part where we just move on? 
Is this the part where you just go home? 
Tell me I‚Äôm dreaming
Say it, oh say you don‚Äôt mean it

Don‚Äôt wanna talk to nobody 
If can‚Äôt lay next to your body 
Get me out of this party 
Where do I go from here?
I know you said that you‚Äôre sorry 
Heard you say that you love me 
So why then you go off running?

Your words so clear
But I can‚Äôt hear
Anything
Cause I know, I know, I know what‚Äôs coming
My biggest fear
Is so sincere
Are you gone, you gone, you gone In the morning?

Don‚Äôt wanna talk to nobody 
If can‚Äôt lay next to your body 
Get me out of this party 
Where do I go from here?
I know you said that you‚Äôre sorry 
Heard you say that you love me 
So why then you go off running?

Where do I go from here? 
Where do I go from here?

Description: A young developer made a pull request in one of Epic Game's repositories, and notified everyone in the EpicGames/developers group.  There's just one problem though, this developers group contains literally everyone who has ever requested the source code to unreal engine, since the only purpose of this group is for Epic games to filter users, collect their github username/email, and force them to sign a tos before getting access to the code.

01:38 Why U No Love Firefox?
03:42 What I want in a web browser
05:03 Firefox Forks
06:35 Epiphany - GNOME Web
07:58 Google Chrome
08:47 Chromium
10:02 Brave
11:21 Vivaldi
12:46 Opera
13:26 Microsoft Edge
14:22 The FINAL CHOICE + full benchmarks

Let's start with why I want to switch from Firefox to something else.

First, Firefox is adding ads in the browser. 

Firefox has telemetry enabled out of the box.

Firefox pushes other services I have no use for, like Pocket.

Firefox doesn't integrate all that well on Linux, and doesn't really look like a native app, unless you use custom userchrome.css, which might be disabled in the future. I like the Proton redesign, but it still doesn't really look like a native application.

Firefox's mobile app isn't great on Android. On iOS, it's just a Safari wrapper, but the interface isn't great either, IMO.

Now, what am I looking for in a browser, apart from a nice daily companion to share my adventures on the wonderful place that is the internet?

I want something that looks at home on my desktop as much as possible, something that looks like it's using GTK or Qt.

I don't need thousands of features and extensions: an ad block, syncing with an account to keep my passwords in sync between devices, or compatibility with a password manager, and that's it.

I need a mobile client that has reasonable performance and a usable interface.

I need decent performance so stuff loads relatively fast and doesn't stutter too much. Anything that performs in the same class as Firefox will work for me.
Ram usage is irrelevant, as I only use computers with 16Gb of RAM or more, so my browsing never really poses a threat to that.

I want a browser that's private out of the box, without opt-out telemetry, ads in the browser, or data collection.

I'd like to avoid chromium based browsers if possible, because Chromium is controlled by Google, however open source it is, and that monopoly kinda scares me. In the end, if it's not possible, I'll live with it. Grumpily, but I'll live with it.

That's about it! We might have to compromise on some of these points, so we'll be attributing a score to each browser. Let's look at what's available.

7:19 - The Bottom Line: CONTROL YOUR DATA
********************* 

Here's a common question I get from viewers: "Which is the most secure cloud storage service?" Instead of going through the encryption protocols for each major company (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, pCloud, iDrive, etc.), we're going to come at it from a different perspective.

How can we control our data in such a way that it doesn't matter which cloud storage service we use?

In this video, we're not just looking at cloud security, we're exploring how you can use best practices and client-side encryption to reduce your trust in the cloud companies and take back control of your own data.

Description: Learn Calculus 1 in this full college course.

This course was created by Dr. Linda Green, a lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Check out her YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkyLJh6hQS1TlhUZxOMjTFw

This course combines two courses taught by Dr. Green. She teaches both Calculus 1 and a Calculus 1 Corequisite course, designed to be taken at the same time. The lectures from the Corquisite course, which review important Algebra and Trigonometry concepts, have been interspersed with the Calculus 1 lectures at the places suggested by Dr. Green.

Google (while its own researchers warn about the negative consequences)... is continuing to push generative AI and "AI Solutions" down our throats with zero remorse. 

The Internet is getting bombarded now by a never ending torrent of AI generated slop, and google (fully aware of what's happening)... has decided that it may just be totally fine with them. From Facebook, to scientific research, AI is infiltrating our everyday lives, backed by trillion dollar corporations and even their own staff members are sounding alarm.

Lyrics:
Sometimes
I wish that I could just quit
But then the other times
There's nobody better than this

Even though you never listen
And you're always right
And I guess I would've never fit your type

Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss

Sometimes,
You say that I'm just too much
But then the other times
Feels like I give you the world
And I won't give up
Oh I never listen
And I take too long
And I guess I would've never fit your song

Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss

Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss

Lyrics:
What a perfect afternoon
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs cloudy, magics all around me
Blame it on a 22
I saw sitting in traffic, fate has got me laughing 

I used to think that worst case 
Would always be in first place
But now I‚Äôm changing my mind

I thought happiness was hard to find
That I could never love my life
If I hadn‚Äôt made it by 25
But today, I‚Äôm waking up with a smile on my face
Everything‚Äôs gonna be great
I don‚Äôt mind the finish line miles away
Cause all I wants in front of me
So I‚Äôm working every day to be
A little more lucky 

What a made up tragedy
Looking at the ocean, and calling it half empty
You could spend a thousand years
(I could die, every day)
Stressing over nothing
Or you could come and join me

I used to think that worst case 
Would always be in first place
But now I‚Äôm changing my mind

I thought happiness was hard to find
That I could never love my life
If I hadn‚Äôt made it by 25
But today, I‚Äôm waking up with a smile on my face
Everything‚Äôs gonna be great
I don‚Äôt mind a finish line miles away
Cause all I wants in front of me
So I‚Äôm working every day to be
A little more lucky 
A little more lucky 

Trust me yeah I‚Äôve got those bad thoughts too
But if you point at the stars they‚Äôll point back at you
Ya I could be mopey and make it true
But I‚Äôm feeling lucky 
Ya I‚Äôm feeling lucky 

I thought happiness was hard to find
That I could never love my life
If I hadn‚Äôt made it by 25
But today, I‚Äôm waking up with a smile on my face
Everything‚Äôs gonna be great
I don‚Äôt mind a finish line miles away
Cause all I wants in front of me
So I‚Äôm working every day to be
A little more lucky

Lyrics:
When I was a boy
I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel
And oh, it made me feel so scared
Then there was joy
Found my religion, swimming in a choir of voices
And oh, I knew that I‚Äôd been spared

That I‚Äôd be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing my life away
That I‚Äôd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing
Keep singing, woah, I keep singing
Clap to the beat til my hands are stinging

And I‚Äôd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away

And I understand
I‚Äôm a wide-eyed father, blessed are the children
Oh, our greatest reward
And with these hands
I‚Äôll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe
Of this you know you can be sure

And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing your life away
And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Clap to the beat til your hands are stinging
And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

Who do you love?
When it all comes down to truth
Who do you love?
When it all comes back to you
Who do you love?
When you‚Äôre lying in your bed
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing
Pray, keep singing, woah, keep singing

And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing your life away
And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Clap to the beat til your hands are stinging
And you‚Äôll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away

Description: Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice ‚Äî first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the source code management system used by developers worldwide. In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. "I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer," Torvalds says. "I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in."

Description: Hello everybody and welcome to Bull Technology. In January of 2022, I posted a video review of Opera GX‚Äîthe gaming focused browser by the infamous Opera Software Corporation. It appears that I had one of the earlier reviews of GX and as far as I can tell, mine was one of the first critical reviews. Well over the past couple years the video has racked up quite a few views (as well as dislikes), and I feel it is time to re-review this infamous browser and answer this question: What‚Äôs changed is it worse, better, and is Opera GX still a terrible browser?

Description: Discord has been pumping out new experiments and concepts, and all of them I'm going to glaze about.

We have new Discord UI concepts that range from Discord themes you find on client mods, all the way up to absolute heat. But we also have a revamp of Discord's discovery page which *chef's kiss* looks good. Nerdy boys like me though will get excited for Discord's bookmarks experiment. Imagine being able to pin any message for yourself only.... none of you are excited. BUT there's a possibility Discord can make it better.

And finally there's the ICYMI tab, which people will complain about.

Back in 2004, Microsoft released a fingerprint reader for Windows XP machines. It sucked as a security product, but could actually be kinda useful if you wanted to easily switch between user accounts on a shared system. So let's see what it could do!

Computer engineering is the combination of electrical engineering and computer science.  Computer engineering majors will take basic circuit analysis classes where they will learn about voltage and current in resistor, capacitor, and inductor circuits.  

They will learn the basics of binary and how computers read 1's and 0's.  Additionally computer engineers learn about memory, registers, microprocessors, and more of the computer hardware.  

Computer engineers will then share many of their classes with computer scientists where they will learn computer programming.  

The curriculum will consist of at least learning C and java.  C programming can then be applied to programming hardware like robotic vehicles.  

After learning different aspects of programming, computer engineers will have an option to take various elective classes that focus on specific aspects of either computer engineering, computer science, or electrical engineering.  Computer engineering is a very flexible major because of having experience on both the hardware and software side so you can cater your career path based on your interests.

Description: There is an ILLEGAL photo that is floating around that if you send it on Discord, YOU WILL GET BANNED. Doesn't matter if it's in DMs or in a Discord server.

This is not some bogus hoax or clickbait garbage, you will get banned. To try to figure out what's going on, I sent the image in an empty Discord server. I tested this on an alt account (and I got banned in 72 seconds, I am the discord ban speedrun champ). But why did I get banned, is the image anything bad? From the surface it's just a normal photo...

Also big big big warning, do not try to send or download this image if you do stumble upon the original. As you will see, this is not an image you want to have lying around.

Description: Every single time you send a Discord message, there is a good chance that behind your back a bot or a selfbot is saving your message. Whether to train AI, doxx you, or track you across Discord.

Now this was and still is a big problem on Discord. Malicious actors could use Discord bots to scrape messages on public servers. But in the past week things have changed. Is it for the better? Well I cant spoil the video geez. But regardless of what Discord does, should you let your guard down or should you think twice before sending that raunchy message to your egirl.

Description: A new Discord experiment has popped up, Secure Frames, and the name doesn't explain anything. But this is Discord's in-development end-to-end encryption for DM calls and server voice chats.

Okay so, a new Discord privacy feature. Sounds great! But in my potentially controversial opinion, I feel like this is going to be less of a feature and more of a marketing tool.

Description: Over 30 people have been spied on for hours on end by a small group of 10 Discord cybercriminals. Everything the victims did on their computer was recorded and sent through a Discord spy bot. And in some rare cases, there were things recorded that shouldn't have been.

And I was able to log into the Discord bot and see everything these criminals have been doing... and I'm disgusted.

Lyrics:

(I‚Äôm throwing a political party, this is the time for a matriarchy)

You said it yourself that you'd be the man
We could really use your mastermind 
Most powerful sword is that pen in your hand
Think of all the wrongs you‚Äôd rewrite
This summer would be far from a cruel one 
My mother would breathe easy if you won 
It's time for the era where you're in control of all of the polls


I'm tired of these old faced guys and their bold faced lies uh-huh 
You should run for president
You got my vote come steal this show uh-huh
You should run for president
Oh what a relief if you took the lead oh please
I'm tired of these old faced guys and their bold faced lies uh-huh 
Taylor, you should run for president


You should run you should run you should run you should run
You should run you should run you should run you should run


I‚Äôm throwing a political party, this is the time for a matriarchy
You‚Äôd be the best thing
In the west wing queen of 13 with her own kind of army 
I‚Äôm throwing a political party, this is the time for a matriarchy
You‚Äôd be the best thing
In the west wing queen of 13 with her own kind of army 


I'm tired of these old faced guys and their bold faced lies uh-huh 
You should run for president
You got my vote come steal this show uh-huh
Taylor, I wish you‚Äôd run for president


Oh what a relief if you took the lead oh please
I'm tired of these old faced guys and their bold faced lies uh-huh 
Taylor, you should run for president
You should run you should run you should run you should run
Taylor, you should run for president

Description: In this one, I make a VTubing Plugin for my friend dot_lvl, which was a secret at the time. The plugin detects when she's yelling and sets a tracking parameter that incrementally makes her shrink. It's like the dril "corn cob" tweet.

Description: DO NOT BRIGADE MATT.

I was incredibly disappointed in Cloudflare's "response" to the recent drama, so I felt like I should use my platform to call it out.

If you don't have clear, explicit, PUBLIC pricing, you're in no position to do stuff like this. Genuinely sad to see CF damaging their brand and scaring their users like this.

Description: ‚Ä¢ See final update video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xwboip8L8c
‚Ä¢ Update (6/17): MemoryC reached out with an apology and explanation, and offered several fair options to remedy the situation including a full refund option which I've decided to go with. They confirmed my hunch that the supplier (the one I mentioned at 7:47) to which they forwarded the board for repair had lost the board, and were upfront about the mistake in not sending an equivalent board and also not at least offering the replacement first, instead of just sending it unsolicited. They said my emails going un-answered was not intentional and that they don't operate that way, and explained it was because an upgrade to their ticketing system was causing my tickets to not show up for some reason. Which I assume is a simplified explanation but I guess I'll choose to take their word for it. Overall I'd say they seemed genuinely apologetic. I'll probably make a follow up video soon with more details once everything is fully sorted.
‚Ä¢ Update 2 (6/18): I received the full refund today and have shipped back the Z690 Hero motherboard to them, so I consider the issue fully resolved.

Description: The Original Xbox launched in 2001 and it brought a few innovations never seen before to the video game console industry. The first would be a built-in hard drive that was not an optional add-on, rather it was a core component of the Xbox hardware. But did the hard drive provide any benefit other than large storage capacity for save games and custom soundtracks? In today's episode we take a closer look at the Xbox hard drive feature and how developers took advantage of it in different ways. Was it really necessary in the end? You decide and let me know in the comments.

Description: This Discord server broke me.

One of my viewers reached out to me about this horrible Discord puberty server. Now, I was either walking directly into some poor advice by teenagers or into something a lot more sinister. But this Discord server surprised me, it was even worse than I expected.

Weird Discord users telling stories that I convince myself are fake. Strange behavior from Discord mods. And finally one of the biggest pieces of irony I've seen.

So today I wanted to take a moment to lay the original 7 Days To Die Console Edition & its community to rest & answer what I believe to be the three still most asked questions regarding 7 Days To Die Console Edition, so enjoy.

There's a bomb in my car. If you haven't seen my previous video on this topic, I recommend watching it because this video won't make that much sense.

While most of these updates and features for iPad OS 18, iOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia aren't exactly new, it was pretty cool seeing them at Apple's 2024 WWDC event. Is their version of AI or "Apple Intelligence" going to be the first one the average person uses on a daily basis? DoesT9 on iPhone matter to anyone but Linus? Will Tim Cook FINALLY find a way to sell more Vision Pros?

Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you


Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you

The "Streisand Effect" is a rather beautiful thing that shows the more you try to remove something off the Internet the more it'll be immortalized. Primink is a fellow creator who made a video on a faux celebrity known as "Lillee Jean" that caused four years of copyright abuse towards his channel. This is a situation that continues to be an issue on YouTube where content is taken down unlawfully and in cases the personal information of creators is left exposed. Thanks for watching!

Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! Recently this year it seems many high-profile games have decided to launch physical copies without the data entirely placed onto them. For the past few years gamers have touted that most physical games you buy have no content on them and serve as a simple license, while in few cases it's true in the vast majority of the sample it appears to not be the case.

Discord is getting a "refresh", which feels like happens every other year. What does this mean in theory? New Discord themes, both free and nitro only. New Discord app icons, nitro only. And one of these new features is actually worthwhile.

But there are some discord experiments (experimental features) that truly bring some hope into my nihilistic eyes. And some of you actually already have access to it. Discord is getting new profiles, new menus, and a extra list in your members list.

Description: At this point it's pretty clear that Youtube only responds when they're publicly put on blast, if youtube shuts me down & lets logan paul prance on his merry way- I'm gonna lose it.
__________________________________________

Here's what I want: 
Yes, I want my channel back. But I want a meeting at Youtube. With REAL HUMANS. With the "people" who run the support team & *personally* investigate hijacked channels. Because it is a broken system and it needs to be changed. I know this is a long shot, but this has been happening for far too long, to far too many creators. There's no way that Youtube has coded & built software to pickup on less than 10 seconds of skewed pitch copyrighted song, yet they're still unable to accurately verify a compromised channel. This needs to change.

W H A T   Y O U   C A N   D O    T O    H E L P :
At this point it's pretty clear that Youtube only responds when they're publicly put on blast, so if you want to help, I would really appreciate it. You can tweet  @YouTube   @ytcreators  @TeamYouTube [Help]  with a link to this video, tell them to give me my channel back (with my videos) and meet with me. If you're a creator with a personal contact at youtube, please send them my video & urge them to meet with me. If you're a press outlet, or you have contact to a press outlet (even just tweeting/tagging) please send them this video.

Description: Two experimental Discord features, message forwarding and recently online, are going to spark outrage and controversy. But is this hoopla even worth caring about? Well, it will change the behavior of those chronically online Discord moderators.

Will it encourage people to go outside? no.... lol idk what you were thinking. These two experimental Discord features will probably lead to more toxicity on Discord. 

Stalking to see when your friend goes offline after they ignore your DM, made easier with the Recently Online feature. And using Discord's built in snitch button (message forwarding) you can forward messages out of context and cause even more drama.
